  abstract = {Precipitation is a global driver of animal abundance and diversity in terrestrial ecosystems, but we know little on how it influences the body size structure of invertebrate communities, particularly soil fauna. It is unclear whether aridity limits the abundance of large-bodied soil invertebrates, and whether temporal precipitation changes can induce local shifts. The potential role of trophic identity in modulating such relationships is also unexplored. Here we investigate the community-weighted mean body mass of soil nematodes, globally wide\- spread invertebrates, in a two-year manipulative experiment with experimental drought and increased rainfall, conducted in three North American grassland ecosystems ranging from arid to semiarid and mesic conditions. We predict that community-weighted mean increases along with precipitation, and that long-term aridity prevents body size shifts in response to within-site temporal changes in precipitation. Nematode community-weighted mean mass increased from arid to mesic conditions. Altered precipitation within sites had much weaker ef\- fects, and none detectable in the arid site. When analysing community-weighted mean mass separately by feeding group, only plant-feeding nematodes responded positively to rainfall addition in semiarid and mesic conditions, as well as to ambient interannual differences consistently across sites, presumably due to a tighter ecological linkage with primary production. Our findings point to aridity as an environmental filter against largebodied soil nematodes, with limited potential for community body size shifts in response to extremely dry or wet years. However, the different responses of plant-feeding taxa from other functional groups indicate potential mismatches between morphologically similar taxa in multitrophic invertebrate communities.},

  abstract = {The relationship between species' body masses and densities is strongly conserved around a three-quarter power law when pooling data across communities. However, studies of local within-community relationships have revealed major deviations from this general pattern, which has profound implications for their stability and functioning. Despite multiple contributions of soil communities to people, there is limited knowledge on the drivers of body mass\textendash abundance relationships in these communities. We compiled a dataset comprising 155 soil\textendash animal communities across four countries (Canada, Germany, Indonesia, USA), all sampled using the same methodology. We tested if variation in local climatic and edaphic conditions drives differences in local body mass\textendash abundance scaling relationships. We found substantial variation in the slopes of this power-law relationship across local communities. Structural equation modeling showed that soil temperature and water content have a positive and negative net effect, respectively, on soil communities. These effects are mediated by changes in local edaphic conditions (soil pH and carbon content) and the body-mass range of the communities. These results highlight ways in which alterations of soil climatic and edaphic conditions interactively impact the distribution of abundance between populations of small and large animals. These quantitative mechanistic relationships facilitate our understanding of how global changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, will affect community\textendash abundance distributions and thus the stability and functioning of soil\textendash animal communities.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecologists and soil modelers have traditionally portrayed the inhabitants of soil as a black box labeled as ``soil fauna'' or ``decomposers or detritivores'' assuming that they just merely recycle the deposited dead plant material. Soil is one of the most diverse habitats on Earth and contains one of the most diverse assemblages of living organisms; however, the opacity of this world has severely limited our understanding of their functional contributions to soil processes and to ecosystem resilience. Traditional taxonomy, based on morphological and anatomical aspects, is becoming replaced by rapid processing molecular techniques (e.g., with marker gene-based approaches). However, this may be impracticable in many ecological studies and consequently, the majority of the current knowledge, still contributes little to our understanding of their role in ecosystem functioning. Over the years, different workers have produced several ``functional classifications'' based on the body width, feeding regime, certain behavioral and reproductive aspects and ecological niches of soil organisms. Unfortunately, the information available is severely restricted to ``major'' groups. A better physiological and metabolic understanding of when and how a complex community of soil organisms access nutrients, alter their environment and in turn, affect soil processes, will allow a more realistic quantitative evaluation of their ecological roles in the biogeochemical cycles. Here, I review the applicability of the available approaches, highlight future research challenges and propose a dynamic conceptual framework that could improve our ability to solve this functional puzzle.},

  abstract = {Indirect measures of soil invertebrate body mass M based on equations relating the latter to body length (l) are becoming increasingly used due to the required painstaking laboratory work and the technical difficulties involved in obtaining some thousands of reliable weight estimates for animals that can be very small. The implicit assumption of such equations is that dM/dV {$\frac{1}{4}$} d, where V is body volume and d is a constant density value. Classical Euclidean scaling implies that Vpl3pM. One may thus derive M from l when the latter can provide a good estimate of V and the assumption of a constant d is respected. In invertebrates, equations relating weight to length indicate that the power model always provides the best fit. However, authors only focused on the empirical estimation of slopes linking the body mass to the length measure variables, sometimes fitting exponential and linear models that are not theoretically grounded. This paper explicates how power laws derive from fundamental Euclidean scaling and describes the expected allometric exponents under the above assumptions. Based on the classical Euclidean scaling theory, an equivalent sphere is defined as a theoretical sphere with a volume equal to that of the organism whose body mass must be estimated. The illustrated application to a data set on soil oribatid mites helps clarify all these issues. Lastly, a general procedure for more precise estimation of M from V and d is suggested.},

Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution\textemdash the part of the distribution representing large but rare events\textemdash and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov\textendash Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

  abstract = {Soils are one of the great unknown realms on earth, despite decades of extensive research. We still see soils ``through a ped darkly''. This opacity in milieu and understanding rewards innovative study, however, as soils are indeed ``complex adaptive systems'', and show very sophisticated levels of self-organization. Viewed historically, soil ecological studies have progressed from what major groups of biota are present, what is their biomass, and what major processes occur. More recent studies have delineated multi-trophic interactions, extending both above- and below-ground, as well as specifically-targeted studies of substrates and organisms that are involved in the development and function of suppressive soils. One of the great unknowns in soil ecology is a fuller understanding of the complete array of predatory biota. Soils are teeming with organisms in all three Domains, but are also rife with many viruses infecting Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, meaning that they need more study in soil processes. Pursuing a more holistic approach including viral biology and ecology may enable us to more capably manage our soils that have supported the biosphere so much over the millennia. Looking into the future, the opportunity to exploit soil biodiversity in the context of ecosystem development should pay considerable dividends. Using chronosequence analysis, the relationships between soil biodiversity and ecosystem function are beginning to be understood. The interplays of aboveground and belowground herbivores on plant function and feedbacks on the attraction of the herbivores' natural enemies. Finally, management of the plant-soil\textendash microbialfaunal system via varied organic amendments shows possibilities in the study and management of suppressive soils.},

  abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data's bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

Hemileius suramericanus (Hammer 1958) is an oribatid mite broadly distributed in the Neotropical Region. We studied the variation in male and female length and width, and in egg number in gravid females, in adults of H. suramericanus from Celtis tala wood patches and surrounding grassland. Samples were taken from soils of two different sized patches of a natural forest of Celtis tala and the grassland area (Pastizal) in the Estancia Nahuel Ruc\'a , Mar Chiquita District, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. In each patch two zones were considered: center and periphery where, litter cover and mechanical resistance, as an estimator of soil compaction, were measured in addition to H. suramericanus population parameters. Females of H. suramericanus were bigger than males in general. Females from the grassland were narrower than those found in the forest patches. Males from the grassland were the smallest. The modal number of eggs per female were two in the bigger patch, and zero in Pastizal and the periphery of the patch smaller. Soil compaction was greater in the grassland than in the forest patches. We propose that litter cover and soil compaction can be factors that determine body size and fecundity, mainly through its effect on food availability.},

  abstract = {The regularity of the community size-spectrum, i.e., the fact that the total ecosystem biomass contained in logarithmically equal body size intervals remains constant, is a striking characteristic of marine ecosystems. Community size-spectrum models exploit this feature to represent marine ecosystems with two measures: the slope and the intercept (height) of the community spectrum. Size-spectrum models have gain popularity over time to model the properties of fish communities, whether to investigate the impact of fishing, or embedded into end-to-end models to investigate the impact of climate. We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size-spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios.},

Potential mechanisms for the frequently observed litter-diversity effects on mass loss and nitrogen dynamics include fungi-driven nutrient transfer among litter species, inhibition or stimulation of microorganisms by specific litter compounds, and positive feedback of soil fauna due to greater habitat and food diversity. Theory predicts positive effects of microbial diversity that result from functional niche complementarity, but the few existing experiments provide conflicting results. Microbial succession with shifting enzymatic capabilities enhances decomposition, whereas antagonistic interactions among fungi that compete for similar resources slow litter decay. Soil-fauna diversity manipulations indicate that the number of trophic levels, species identity, and the presence of keystone species have a strong impact on decomposition, whereas the importance of diversity within functional groups is not clear at present. In conclusion, litter species and decomposer diversity can significantly influence carbon and nutrient turnover rates; however, no general or predictable pattern has emerged. Proposed mechanisms for diversity effects need confirmation and a link to functional traits for a comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity interacts with decomposition processes and the consequences of ongoing biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning.},

Our purpose was to develop such a model for terrestrial gastropods that adequately predicted gastropod dry tissue biomass (Y) on the basis of animal length (X). The power equation Y = 0. 172X1hX8 (r2 = 0.85) proved to be the best + + model for this purpose. Gastropod dry tissue biomass was 6.52 1.58 mg (mean SE) and, based on gastropod densities ranging frok 2 to 38/m2 reported in the literature, snails and slugs active on the surface of the forest floor accounted for 2.5 and 6 \% of the total animal biomass and energy, respectively, of boreal forest ecosystems. However, because densities of gastropods in both the litter and underlying soil can reach 1607/m2, our results suggest that published values for total animal biomass (4.9 g/m2)and caloric energy (lo4 cal/m2)in boreal forest ecosystems are underestimated.},

  abstract = {In community ecology, trait-based approaches have been strongly recommended in recent years to understand the responses of community functions against environmental changes. Trait-based approaches have been used to solve the mechanistic rules in the relationship between soil animal communities and environmental change. However, databases of functional traits of soil animals are still lacking. Collembola is one of the most abundant and diverse group in land ecosystems, with more than 400 identified species in Japan. This dataset provides taxonomic information, geographic, habitat distributions, and 13 morphological trait items of 407 species of Japanese Collembola: described in Japanese literature. The workshop of Japanese Collembola, supported by the Japanese Society of Soil Zoology, summarized the taxonomy for the Japanese Collembola species. The dataset presented here is mainly based on their work. The spatial coverage of this dataset is in the land area of Japan. Suborder, superfamily, family, subfamily, genus, and species names, as well as common Japanese names, are listed in this paper. The species distributions of Japanese Collembola in each global ecozone and in each area within Japan were described. Habitat preference for soil, cave, seashore, and tree trunk habitats were recorded. The 13 morphological traits of Collembola species, which are body length; body weight of adult individual; body form; antenna length; furca length; body pigmentation; pairs of ocelli (eyes); post-antennal organ (PAO); pseudocelli; body scale; anal spine; mandible; and molar plate are listed in this dataset. These 13 morphological traits in this dataset are covered the most of trait items which have been internationally used in Collembola study. Trait-based studies of Collembola have mainly been for European species, most of which are not found in Japan or East Asia. These datasets may provide an important first step to incorporating community data from the Asian region to the trait-based global ecology. Data files are stored in the Ecological Research Data Archives (ERDP-2019-03).}

We illustrate our new approach, and relate it to previous approaches, by analyzing data from the pelagic community of a small lake, Tuesday Lake, in Michigan. Although many of the relationships we describe have been well studied individually, we are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. An overview of some of the results of the present study, with further theoretical extensions, has been published elsewhere (Cohen et al., 2003). Our new approach yields four major results. Though many patterns in the structure of an ecological community have been traditionally treated as independent, they are in fact connected. In at least one real ecosystem, many of these patterns are relatively robust after a major perturbation. Some of these patterns may be predictably consistent from one community to another. Locally, however, some community characteristics need not necessarily coincide with previously reported patterns for guilds or larger geographical scales. We describe our major findings under these headings: trivariate relation- ships (that is, relationships combining the food web, body size, and species abundance); bivariate relationships; univariate relationships; and the eVects of food web perturbation.},

Despite the tremendous diversity of organisms that soil food webs harbor, we still know surprisingly little about the role of biodiversity in influencing the processes and services provided by soil food webs. To guide future research in this area, we outline a conceptual framework linking hierarchical levels of soil biodiversity to ecosystem processes and services. Here, we distinguish among different hierarchical levels of diversity: trophic, functional, taxonomic and genetic diversity. We conclude that the levels of food web diversity that matter most vary with the processes or services considered, with functional trait diversity being the most universally influential level of diversity. Increased research emphasis on manipulating diversity across hierarchical levels of biodiversity organization, with an explicit focus on the functional role of the component species, is critical for enhancing our understanding of the role of soil food web diversity in driving ecosystem processes and services.},

  abstract = {In aquatic ecosystems, where organisms typically feed and grow by eating smaller individuals, a characteristic size spectrum emerges, such that large organisms are much more rare than small ones. Here, a stochastic individual-based model for the dynamics of size spectra is described, based on birth, growth, and death of individuals, using simple assumptions about feeding behavior. It is shown that the deterministic limit derived from the stochastic process is a partial differential equation previously used to describe the dynamics of size spectra. The equation has two classes of dynamics in the long term. The first is a steady state. A derivation under simple mass-balance assumptions shows that, at steady state, the linear size spectrum relating log abundance to log mass has a slope of approximately -1, similar to that often observed in natural size spectra. The second class of dynamics, not previously described, is a traveling-wave solution in which waves move along the size spectrum from small to large body size. Traveling waves become more likely when predators prefer prey much smaller than themselves and when they are specialized in the range of prey body sizes consumed. Wavelength depends on the size of prey relative to the size of predator, and wave speed depends on how fast mass moves through the spectrum.},

This chapter lays out a powerful approach to answering this question, based on the concepts of a regional species pool and environmental filters. The species pool is the set of species that could potentially colonize a local site or community. Of these potential colonists, some species are limited in their ability to disperse to site, some are limited by their ability to survive the abiotic environment, and some are limited by their interactions with other species. These ``filters'' act individually or in concert, and the functional traits of species determine their success in passing through these filters to colonize a local site. There is growing empirical evidence that both abiotic and biotic processes select for specific functional traits. Focusing on the functional traits of species may lead to rules of community assembly that are general and help unify a variety of more specific theories.},

The specific goal was the identification of ``reference'' states for soil sustainability and ecosystem functioning in grazed vs. ungrazed sites. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacterial cells were counted by fluorescent staining and combined direct microscopy and automatic image analysis; invertebrates (nematodes, mites, insects, oligochaetes) were sampled and their body size measured individually to allow allometric scaling. Numerical allometry analyses food webs by a direct comparison of weight averages of components and thus might characterize the detrital soil food webs of our 135 sites regardless of taxonomy. Sharp differences in the frequency distributions are shown. Overall higher biomasses of invertebrates occur in grasslands, and all larger soil organisms differed remarkably. Conclusions/Significance: Strong statistical evidence supports a hypothesis explaining from an allometric perspective how the faunal biomass distribution and the energetic flux are affected by livestock, nutrient availability and land use. Our aim is to propose faunal biomass flux and biomass distribution as quantitative descriptors of soil community composition and function, and to illustrate the application of these allometric indicators to soil systems.},

About 250 species were treated separately, of which the collembolan Tullbergia kraus  baueri dominated the abundance and the lumbricid Allolobophora rosea the biomass and  respiration. The annual mean abundance of 247 000 (s.e. = 18 000) ind. m-2 was domi  nated by Collembola (44 \%) and Acari (43 \%). The annual mean biomass of 10.6 (s.e. =  0.75) g dw m-2 was dominated by Lumbricidae (56 \%) and Cole?ptera (27 \%). The  annual respiration of 200 (s.e. = 25) kcal m\textasciitilde 2 yr-1 was also dominated by Lumbricidae  (38 \%), but Enchytraeidae (21 \%), Cole?ptera (21 \%) and Diptera (15 \%) contributed  significantly to the total respiratory metabolism. Three feeding categories were distin  guished, of which the saprovores/microbivores accounted for 75 \%, the herbivores for  15 \% and the carnivores for 10 \% of the total annual respiration.  The net primary production, plant litter production and the rejecta and carcasses  from the above-ground arthropods were also estimated in order to relate the soil animal  respiration to various inputs of energy to the soil system.

  abstract = {It is generally recognized that larger animals eat more, live longer, have larger offspring, and so on; but it is unusual to see these commonplace observations as a basis for scientific biology. A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions. It will interest advanced students of ecology and comparative physiology as well as professional biologists.},

  abstract = {Many ecosystem functions depend on the structure of food webs, which heavily relies on the body size spectrum of the community. Despite that, little is known on how the size spectrum of soil animals responds to agricultural practices in tropical land-use systems and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. We studied land-use-induced changes in below-ground communities in tropical lowland ecosystems in Sumatra (Jambi province, Indonesia), a hot spot of tropical rainforest conversion into rubber and oil palm plantations. The study included ca. 30,000 measured individuals from 33 high-order taxa of meso- and macrofauna spanning eight orders of magnitude in body mass. Using individual body masses, we calculated the metabolism of trophic guilds and used food web models to calculate energy fluxes and infer ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, herbivory, primary and intraguild predation. Land-use change was associated with reduced abundance and taxonomic diversity of soil invertebrates, but strong increase in total biomass and moderate changes in total energy flux. These changes were due to increased biomass of large-sized decomposers in soil, in particular earthworms, with their share in community metabolism increasing from 11\% in rainforest to 59\%\textendash 76\% in jungle rubber, and rubber and oil palm plantations. Decomposition, that is the energy flux to decomposers, stayed unchanged, but herbivory, primary and intraguild predation decreased by an order of magnitude in plantation systems. Intraguild predation was very important, being responsible for 38\% of the energy flux in rainforest according to our model. Conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations is associated by an uneven loss of size classes and trophic levels of soil invertebrates resulting in sequestration of energy in large-sized primary consumers and restricted flux of energy to higher trophic levels. Pronounced differences between rainforest and jungle rubber reflect sensitivity of rainforest soil animal communities to moderate land-use changes. Soil communities in plantation systems sustained high total energy flux despite reduced biodiversity. The high energy flux into large decomposers but low energy fluxes into other trophic guilds suggests that trophic multifunctionality of below-ground communities is compromised in plantation systems.},

  abstract = {Size-structured food webs form integrated trophic systems where energy is channeled from small to large consumers. Empirical evidence suggests that size structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in terrestrial food webs trophic position is largely independent of body size. Compartmentalization of energy channeling according to size classes of consumers was suggested as a mechanism that underpins functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs including those belowground, but their structure has not been empirically assessed across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude in living body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative correlation between trophic position and body mass in invertebrate communities and a remarkable nonlinearity in community metabolism and trophic positions across all size classes. Specifically, we found that the correlation between body mass and trophic level is positive in the small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods below 1 {$\mu$}g in body mass), neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 {$\mu$}g to 1 mg), and negative in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), suggesting that these groups form compartments with different trophic organization. Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food webs being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2) arthropod macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and trophic level, hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing aboveground predators; and (3) ``trophic whales,'' sequestering energy in their large bodies and restricting its propagation to higher trophic levels in belowground food webs. The three size compartments are based on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to different ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely used vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs can be complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a balance across individual size compartments.},

  abstract = {The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a `multichannel' food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess `trophic multifunctionality' (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity\textendash ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground\textendash aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.},

Very different types of scaling have been studied, based on either individuals or species. The individual size distribution (ISD) describes the distribution of individual-organism body masses regardless of taxonomy, and contains the same information as the abundance spectrum. Focusing instead on species, the local size\textendash density relationship (LSDR) plots population densities vs. mean body masses of species. The distribution of species mean body masses (the species-mean-size distribution, SMSD) is also important but previously little studied in webs. We here combine and formalize theory of several authors to predict: how these three descriptions are related; the forms of the LSDR and ISD; and variation in scaling among webs. We describe empirically the SMSDs of two pelagic, one estuarine, and 146 soil webs by power laws and generalizations. We test theory and find it broadly validated.},

For the first time, isometry (an inverse 1 : 1 proportion) is recognized in mass-abundance relationships, providing a functional signal for constant biomass distribution in soil biota regardless of discrete trophic levels. Our findings are in contrast to those from aquatic ecosystems, in that higher trophic levels in soil biota are not a direct function of increasing body mass.},

Accurate knowledge of trophic relations is central for the understanding of ecosystem dynamics, which in turn, is essential for food web stability analyzes and the development of sustainable practices. There is a rapid growth in the knowledge on how belowground biodiversity regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although, the available information about trophic relationships is hard to find and fragmented. This gathering the information available worldwide about the food resources of soil mesofauna. From the 3105 hits of the initial search on food resources of soil microarthropods, only a total of 196 published works related particular species, genera, and families to particular trophic resources, the majority of them dealing with soils of the Palearctic region. From the 196 publications we extracted 3009 records relating specific taxonomic groups to their trophic resources, 20\% mention saprophytic fungi as a food resource, 16\% cite microfauna, 11\% mention bacteria, 10\% litter and 5\% cite Mycorrhizal fungi. The available information was highly skewed, the 73.71\% comes from Acari, and within these, 50.62\% correspond just to Sarcoptiformes. For Collembola, the literature is scarce, the majority coming from Arthropleona. This review highlights the general lack of information relating species, genera, and families of the soil mesofauna to specific trophic resources. It also highlights that available research mostly comes from European sites, with the use of trophic resources by the mesofauna of the majority of the soils in other parts of the world still largely unknown.},

Biodiversity is taken to be the integration of biological variability across all scales, from the genetic, through species and ecosystems, to landscapes. Conserving biodiversity is a daunting task, and the paper asserts that focusing on species is not the best approach. The best way to minimize species loss is to maintain the integrity of ecosystem function. The important questions therefore concern the kinds of biodiversity that are significant to ecosystem functioning. To best focus our efforts we need to establish how much (or how little) redundancy there is in the biological composition of ecosystems. An approach is suggested, based on the use of functional groups of organisms defined according to ecosystem processes. Functional groups with little or no redundancy warrant priority conservation effort. Complementary species-based approaches for maximizing the inclusion of biodiversity within a set of conservation areas are compared to the functional-group approach.}

  abstract = {How community structure responds to environmental changes in space and time is a key concern in ecology. As a synthesized indicator of community structure, the density\textendash body mass (DBM) relationship reflecting body size distributions can serve as a linkage between community response and ecological processes and function. However, the drivers of the spatial and temporal shifts in the DBM relationship for brown food webs remain largely unknown. This study aimed to find the elevational pattern of body size distributions of litter invertebrate communities and understand the causes of climate and resource factors shaping this pattern in different spatio-temporal contexts. We identified the elevational pattern of body size distributions of litter invertebrates in a temperate montane forest and, for the first time, examined this pattern by taking account of the temporal contexts integrating the growing and dormant seasons. Furthermore, we assessed the relative roles of climate factors (i.e., temperature, light, and moisture) and resource factors (i.e., litter quality and quantity) in body size distribution patterns. In general, we demonstrated litter invertebrate communities were size-structured at all elevations and in different seasons, which underpins the DBM. However, the elevational patterns of the DBM slopes varied between seasons: In the growing season the DBM slopes were shallower with increasing elevation. Contrasting, the DBM slopes were steeper with increasing elevation in the dormant season. This is indicating that along the elevation, the larger litter invertebrates benefited more in the growing season compared with the smaller invertebrates, which benefited more in the dormant season. The drivers of the DBM relationship were context dependent: (1) temperature was a fundamental driver for the DBM relationship across space and time, with increasing temperature benefiting smaller invertebrates; (2) crown density only matters in the dormant season, with increasing light intensity benefiting larger invertebrates. No impact of soil moisture on the body size distributions was detected; and (3) litter availability impact varied with season in quality (i.e., litter C:N and C:S ratios) and quantity (i.e., litter amount), mainly functioning in the growing and the dormant season, respectively. This finding would enhance a more predictive understanding of how environmental change may restructure ecosystems and soil functioning from an allometric scaling perspective in the context of global warming.},

  abstract = {Agricultural expansion is among the main threats to biodiversity and functions of tropical ecosystems. It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated {$\Delta$}13C values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.},

  abstract = {Tropical forests shelter an unparalleled biological diversity. The relative influence of environmental selection (i.e., abiotic conditions, biotic interactions) and stochastic\textendash distance-\-dependent neutral processes (i.e., demography, dispersal) in shaping communities has been extensively studied for various organisms, but has rarely been explored across a large range of body sizes, in particular in soil environments. We built a detailed census of the whole soil biota in a 12-h\- a tropical forest plot using soil DNA metabarcoding. We show that the distribution of 19 taxonomic groups (ranging from microbes to mesofauna) is primarily stochastic, suggesting that neutral processes are prominent drivers of the assembly of these communities at this scale. We also identify aluminium, topography and plant species identity as weak, yet significant drivers of soil richness and community composition of bacteria, protists and to a lesser extent fungi. Finally, we show that body size, which determines the scale at which an organism perceives its environment, predicted the community assembly across taxonomic groups, with soil mesofauna assemblages being more stochastic than microbial ones. These results suggest that the relative contribution of neutral processes and environmental selection to community assembly directly depends on body size. Body size is hence an important determinant of community assembly rules at the scale of the ecological community in tropical soils and should be accounted for in spatial models of tropical soil food webs.},
