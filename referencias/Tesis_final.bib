  abstract = {The relationship between species' body masses and densities is strongly conserved around a three-quarter power law when pooling data across communities. However, studies of local within-community relationships have revealed major deviations from this general pattern, which has profound implications for their stability and functioning. Despite multiple contributions of soil communities to people, there is limited knowledge on the drivers of body mass\textendash abundance relationships in these communities. We compiled a dataset comprising 155 soil\textendash animal communities across four countries (Canada, Germany, Indonesia, USA), all sampled using the same methodology. We tested if variation in local climatic and edaphic conditions drives differences in local body mass\textendash abundance scaling relationships. We found substantial variation in the slopes of this power-law relationship across local communities. Structural equation modeling showed that soil temperature and water content have a positive and negative net effect, respectively, on soil communities. These effects are mediated by changes in local edaphic conditions (soil pH and carbon content) and the body-mass range of the communities. These results highlight ways in which alterations of soil climatic and edaphic conditions interactively impact the distribution of abundance between populations of small and large animals. These quantitative mechanistic relationships facilitate our understanding of how global changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature and precipitation, will affect community\textendash abundance distributions and thus the stability and functioning of soil\textendash animal communities.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous samplings of soil organisms were performed during a 14-month-period in a 120-year-old Scots pine forest. About 50 microfungal and more than 200 animal species were identified. Abundance, hyphal length, biomass and respiratory metabolism were estimated for bacteria, fungi, protozoans, nema todes, rotifers, tardigrades, enchytraeids, micro- and macroarthropods, which were also classified into trophic categories. Annual mean biomass of fungi was high (120 g dw m"2) but, on average, only 2\% was metabolically active according to the FDA-method. Bacteria had a remarkably high mean biomass (39 gm"2) for being found in an acidic soil. Soil animals had a low mean biomass (1.7 g m"2). FDA-active fungal biomass reached maxima in late autumn and early spring with minima in between. Biomass peaks were estimated in late summer for protozoans and early autumn for bacteria, while most animal groups had biomass maxima in late autumn. In the soil profile all organism groups had biomass maxima in the upper horizons, but the animal biomass decreased more abruptly with increasing depth than the microorganism biomass. Annual carbon flow through the organisms was calculated on the basis of respiration values. In terms of carbon, bacteria appeared to be more important for decomposition than fungi, and animal saprovores had little significance. The soil fauna contributed 4\% to the annual heterotrophic respiration. Despite the low respiration, bacterivores and fungivores were estimated to remove as much as 30-60\% of the annual production of bacteria and fungi in the litter and humus layers. The consumption pressure was suggested to reduce microorganism biomass and increase turnover and mineralization rate of mineral nutrients. Carnivore pr?dation was very high, while root consumption was negligible. Fungivore grazing of mycor rhizal fungi was believed to affect the roots more pronouncedly than the rhizophages did.},

  abstract = {Background: ``The enigma of soil animal species diversity'' was the title of a popular article by J. M. Anderson published in 1975. In that paper, Anderson provided insights on the great richness of species found in soils, but emphasized that the mechanisms contributing to the high species richness belowground were largely unknown. Yet, exploration of the mechanisms driving species richness has focused, almost exclusively, on above-ground plant and animal communities, and nearly 35 years later we have several new hypotheses but are not much closer to revealing why soils are so rich in species. One persistent but untested hypothesis is that species richness is promoted by small-scale environmental heterogeneity. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test this hypothesis we manipulated small-scale heterogeneity in soil properties in a one-year field experiment and investigated the impacts on the richness of soil fauna and evenness of the microbial communities. We found that heterogeneity substantially increased the species richness of oribatid mites, collembolans and nematodes, whereas heterogeneity had no direct influence on the evenness of either the fungal, bacterial or archaeal communities or on species richness of the large and mobile mesostigmatid mites. These results suggest that the heterogeneity-species richness relationship is scale dependent. Conclusions: Our results provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that small-scale heterogeneity in soils increase species richness of intermediate-sized soil fauna. The concordance of mechanisms between above and belowground communities suggests that the relationship between environmental heterogeneity and species richness may be a general property of ecological communities.},

  abstract = {Terrestrial ecologists and soil modelers have traditionally portrayed the inhabitants of soil as a black box labeled as ``soil fauna'' or ``decomposers or detritivores'' assuming that they just merely recycle the deposited dead plant material. Soil is one of the most diverse habitats on Earth and contains one of the most diverse assemblages of living organisms; however, the opacity of this world has severely limited our understanding of their functional contributions to soil processes and to ecosystem resilience. Traditional taxonomy, based on morphological and anatomical aspects, is becoming replaced by rapid processing molecular techniques (e.g., with marker gene-based approaches). However, this may be impracticable in many ecological studies and consequently, the majority of the current knowledge, still contributes little to our understanding of their role in ecosystem functioning. Over the years, different workers have produced several ``functional classifications'' based on the body width, feeding regime, certain behavioral and reproductive aspects and ecological niches of soil organisms. Unfortunately, the information available is severely restricted to ``major'' groups. A better physiological and metabolic understanding of when and how a complex community of soil organisms access nutrients, alter their environment and in turn, affect soil processes, will allow a more realistic quantitative evaluation of their ecological roles in the biogeochemical cycles. Here, I review the applicability of the available approaches, highlight future research challenges and propose a dynamic conceptual framework that could improve our ability to solve this functional puzzle.},

  abstract = {The soil environment is likely the most complex biological community. Soil organisms are extremely diverse and contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential to the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. The soil organism community can have direct and indirect impacts on land productivity. Direct impacts are those where specific organisms affect crop yield immediately. Indirect effects include those provided by soil organisms participating in carbon and nutrient cycles, soil structure modification and food web interactions that generate ecosystem services that ultimately affect productivity. Recognizing the great biological and functional diversity in the soil and the complexity of ecological interactions it becomes necessary to focus in this paper on soil biota that have a strong linkage to functions which underpin `soil based' ecosystem services. Selected organisms from different functional groups (i.e. microsymbionts, decomposers, elemental transformers, soil ecosystem engineers, soil-borne pest and diseases, and microregulators) are used to illustrate the linkages of soil biota and ecosystem services essential to life on earth as well as with those associated with the provision of goods and the regulation of ecosystem processes. These services are not only essential to ecosystem function but also a critical resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. Research opportunities and gaps related to methodological, experimental and conceptual approaches that may be helpful to address the challenge of linking soil biodiversity and function to the provision of ecosystem services and land productivity are discussed. These include: 1) integration of spatial variability research in soil ecology and a focus on `hot spots' of biological activity, 2) using a selective functional group approach to study soil biota and function, 3) combining new and existing methodological approaches that link selected soil organisms, the temporal and spatial dynamics of their function, and their contribution to the provision of selected `soil based' ecosystem services, 4) using understanding about hierarchical relationships to manage soil biota and function in cropping systems, 5) using local knowledge about plants as indicators of soil quality, remote sensing and GIS technologies, and plant-soil biota interactions to help understand the impacts of soil biota at landscape scale, and 6) developing land quality monitoring systems that inform land users about their land's ecosystem service performance, improve capacities to predict and adapt to environmental changes, and support policy and decision-making.},

It is concluded that the fundamental niche requirements of small soil animals are cosmopolitan units while those of larger animals are more restricted. Many species of micro- and mesofauna, however, are not eurytopic and the separation of ecologically equivalent species groups is discussed in relation to soil moisture and vegetation types. The divergence in opinion over the relationship between higher plants and the distribution of Collembola and mites might be resolved if the vegetation was described in biochemical terms and not by plant species. The organization of microarthropod communities within habitats is discussed with respect to food, space, time and mortality phenomena. Cryptostigmata exhibit some evidence of trophic differentiation with respect to body size but the differences are insufficient to account for the number of similar sized species within the guild. Potentially competitive species may also be spatially separated and a relationship is described between mite species diversity and microhabitat diversity. Catastrophic mortality and pr?dation contribute significantly to community organization and many animals are probably fugitive species within the habitat mosaic in space and time. The effects of these sources of mortality may be emphasised by the slow recovery of populations due to nutrient limitations to growth.},

About 250 species were treated separately, of which the collembolan Tullbergia kraus  baueri dominated the abundance and the lumbricid Allolobophora rosea the biomass and  respiration. The annual mean abundance of 247 000 (s.e. = 18 000) ind. m-2 was domi  nated by Collembola (44 \%) and Acari (43 \%). The annual mean biomass of 10.6 (s.e. =  0.75) g dw m-2 was dominated by Lumbricidae (56 \%) and Cole?ptera (27 \%). The  annual respiration of 200 (s.e. = 25) kcal m{\textasciitilde}2 yr-1 was also dominated by Lumbricidae  (38 \%), but Enchytraeidae (21 \%), Cole?ptera (21 \%) and Diptera (15 \%) contributed  significantly to the total respiratory metabolism. Three feeding categories were distin  guished, of which the saprovores/microbivores accounted for 75 \%, the herbivores for  15 \% and the carnivores for 10 \% of the total annual respiration.  The net primary production, plant litter production and the rejecta and carcasses  from the above-ground arthropods were also estimated in order to relate the soil animal  respiration to various inputs of energy to the soil system.

  abstract = {There is a vast diversity of organisms that live in the soil, and the activities of the total soil biota, together with the diverse forms and functions of plant roots, have critical roles in soil functioning. In this paper I discuss the likely determinants of soil diversity and also comment on recent studies that have explored whether or not there is a relationship between soil organism diversity and ecosystem function. There is little evidence to suggest that soil diversity is regulated in a predicable fashion by competition or disturbance; rather it is attributed to the nature of the soil environment, in that soil offers an extremely heterogeneous habitat, both spatially and temporally, proving unrivalled potential for niche partitioning, or resource or habitat specialisation, thereby enabling co-existence of species. Most evidence that is available suggests that there is no predictable relationship between diversity and function in soils, and that ecosystem properties are governed more by individual traits of dominant species, and by the extraordinary complexity of biotic interactions that occur between components of soil food webs. There is evidence of redundancy in soil communities with respect to soil functions, but the scale of effect of changes in soil diversity on process rates depends on which species are removed from the community and the degree to which remaining species can compensate. As in aboveground communities, therefore, it would appear that species traits and changes in species composition, and alterations in the nature of the many important species interactions that occur in soil, are likely to be the main biotic control of ecosystem function. In view of this, consideration of these important biotic interactions and their sensitivity to environmental change must be a key priority for future research.},

Although intensive agricultural activity is leading to important levels of soil degradation, studies on the impact on soil fauna are scarce. Despite the environmental importance of collembolans, symphylans and pauropods in soil, information on the influence of land management on their population densities is poor, particularly in Neotropical agroecosystems. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different management systems on the density of collembolans, symphylans and pauropods. Population abundance of these arthropods was examined in a natural site and a cattle raising, a mixed and an agricultural management system on a Typic Hapludoll soil in La Colacha, Cordoba, Argentina. All the sites studied had the same land use history until approximately 50 years before sampling and have the same soil type. Total abundance of the studied groups varied in the different management systems. Our results suggest that conventional agricultural management tends to reduce the density of collembolans and pauropods. Our data do not support our hypothesis that the cattle raising management system constitutes an intermediate situation between the natural site and the high-input management systems. We conclude that the reduction of collembolan and pauropod densities in high-input management systems is largely explained by the mechanical and chemical perturbations produced by conventional agricultural management practices and by particular abiotic soil conditions present in the intensively managed sites that are unfavourable for these organisms. Surprisingly, symphylans were more abundant in the mixed management site. The implications of our findings on soil ecosystem functioning are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many ecosystem functions depend on the structure of food webs, which heavily relies on the body size spectrum of the community. Despite that, little is known on how the size spectrum of soil animals responds to agricultural practices in tropical land-use systems and how these responses affect ecosystem functioning. We studied land-use-induced changes in below-ground communities in tropical lowland ecosystems in Sumatra (Jambi province, Indonesia), a hot spot of tropical rainforest conversion into rubber and oil palm plantations. The study included ca. 30,000 measured individuals from 33 high-order taxa of meso- and macrofauna spanning eight orders of magnitude in body mass. Using individual body masses, we calculated the metabolism of trophic guilds and used food web models to calculate energy fluxes and infer ecosystem functions, such as decomposition, herbivory, primary and intraguild predation. Land-use change was associated with reduced abundance and taxonomic diversity of soil invertebrates, but strong increase in total biomass and moderate changes in total energy flux. These changes were due to increased biomass of large-sized decomposers in soil, in particular earthworms, with their share in community metabolism increasing from 11\% in rainforest to 59\%--76\% in jungle rubber, and rubber and oil palm plantations. Decomposition, that is the energy flux to decomposers, stayed unchanged, but herbivory, primary and intraguild predation decreased by an order of magnitude in plantation systems. Intraguild predation was very important, being responsible for 38\% of the energy flux in rainforest according to our model. Conversion of rainforest into monoculture plantations is associated by an uneven loss of size classes and trophic levels of soil invertebrates resulting in sequestration of energy in large-sized primary consumers and restricted flux of energy to higher trophic levels. Pronounced differences between rainforest and jungle rubber reflect sensitivity of rainforest soil animal communities to moderate land-use changes. Soil communities in plantation systems sustained high total energy flux despite reduced biodiversity. The high energy flux into large decomposers but low energy fluxes into other trophic guilds suggests that trophic multifunctionality of below-ground communities is compromised in plantation systems.},

  abstract = {Size-structured food webs form integrated trophic systems where energy is channeled from small to large consumers. Empirical evidence suggests that size structure prevails in aquatic ecosystems, whereas in terrestrial food webs trophic position is largely independent of body size. Compartmentalization of energy channeling according to size classes of consumers was suggested as a mechanism that underpins functioning and stability of terrestrial food webs including those belowground, but their structure has not been empirically assessed across the whole size spectrum. Here we used stable isotope analysis and metabolic regressions to describe size structure and energy use in eight belowground communities with consumers spanning 12 orders of magnitude in living body mass, from protists to earthworms. We showed a negative correlation between trophic position and body mass in invertebrate communities and a remarkable nonlinearity in community metabolism and trophic positions across all size classes. Specifically, we found that the correlation between body mass and trophic level is positive in the small-sized (protists, nematodes, arthropods below 1 {$\mu$}g in body mass), neutral in the medium-sized (arthropods of 1 {$\mu$}g to 1 mg), and negative in the large-sized consumers (large arthropods, earthworms), suggesting that these groups form compartments with different trophic organization. Based on this pattern, we propose a concept of belowground food webs being composed of (1) size-structured micro-food web driving fast energy channeling and nutrient release, for example in microbial loop; (2) arthropod macro-food web with no clear correlation between body size and trophic level, hosting soil arthropod diversity and subsidizing aboveground predators; and (3) ``trophic whales,'' sequestering energy in their large bodies and restricting its propagation to higher trophic levels in belowground food webs. The three size compartments are based on a similar set of basal resources, but contribute to different ecosystem-level functions and respond differently to variations in climate, soil characteristics and land use. We suggest that the widely used vision of resource-based energy channeling in belowground food webs can be complemented with size-based energy channeling, where ecosystem multifunctionality, biodiversity, and stability are supported by a balance across individual size compartments.},

Body size spectrum analyses have been applied to great effect in aquatic systems, but have only relatively recently gained interest for the description of soil communities. This approach should be added to existing sorting protocols and adopted as a standard tool of soil fauna analysis because of its ease of use, universal applicability regardless of taxonomy, and value as a predictor of both soil fauna function and response. This paper reviews the available methods for calculating soil fauna mass, constructing of body size spectra, and relating these spectra to existing fauna analysis frameworks such as the nematode maturity index. We also detail several of the functional conclusions that can be drawn from shifts in body size spectra and how this methodology can be further improved to supplement existing soil ecology methods. {\'O} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Soils are one of the great unknown realms on earth, despite decades of extensive research. We still see soils ``through a ped darkly''. This opacity in milieu and understanding rewards innovative study, however, as soils are indeed ``complex adaptive systems'', and show very sophisticated levels of self-organization. Viewed historically, soil ecological studies have progressed from what major groups of biota are present, what is their biomass, and what major processes occur. More recent studies have delineated multi-trophic interactions, extending both above- and below-ground, as well as specifically-targeted studies of substrates and organisms that are involved in the development and function of suppressive soils. One of the great unknowns in soil ecology is a fuller understanding of the complete array of predatory biota. Soils are teeming with organisms in all three Domains, but are also rife with many viruses infecting Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, meaning that they need more study in soil processes. Pursuing a more holistic approach including viral biology and ecology may enable us to more capably manage our soils that have supported the biosphere so much over the millennia. Looking into the future, the opportunity to exploit soil biodiversity in the context of ecosystem development should pay considerable dividends. Using chronosequence analysis, the relationships between soil biodiversity and ecosystem function are beginning to be understood. The interplays of aboveground and belowground herbivores on plant function and feedbacks on the attraction of the herbivores' natural enemies. Finally, management of the plant-soil--microbialfaunal system via varied organic amendments shows possibilities in the study and management of suppressive soils.},

  abstract = {Precipitation is a global driver of animal abundance and diversity in terrestrial ecosystems, but we know little on how it influences the body size structure of invertebrate communities, particularly soil fauna. It is unclear whether aridity limits the abundance of large-bodied soil invertebrates, and whether temporal precipitation changes can induce local shifts. The potential role of trophic identity in modulating such relationships is also unexplored. Here we investigate the community-weighted mean body mass of soil nematodes, globally wide\- spread invertebrates, in a two-year manipulative experiment with experimental drought and increased rainfall, conducted in three North American grassland ecosystems ranging from arid to semiarid and mesic conditions. We predict that community-weighted mean increases along with precipitation, and that long-term aridity prevents body size shifts in response to within-site temporal changes in precipitation. Nematode community-weighted mean mass increased from arid to mesic conditions. Altered precipitation within sites had much weaker ef\- fects, and none detectable in the arid site. When analysing community-weighted mean mass separately by feeding group, only plant-feeding nematodes responded positively to rainfall addition in semiarid and mesic conditions, as well as to ambient interannual differences consistently across sites, presumably due to a tighter ecological linkage with primary production. Our findings point to aridity as an environmental filter against largebodied soil nematodes, with limited potential for community body size shifts in response to extremely dry or wet years. However, the different responses of plant-feeding taxa from other functional groups indicate potential mismatches between morphologically similar taxa in multitrophic invertebrate communities.},

The relative influence of environmental selection (i.e., abiotic conditions, biotic interactions) and stochastic--distance-\-dependent neutral processes (i.e., demography, dispersal) in shaping communities has been extensively studied for various organisms, but has rarely been explored across a large range of body sizes, in particular in soil environments. We built a detailed census of the whole soil biota in a 12-h\- a tropical forest plot using soil DNA metabarcoding. We show that the distribution of 19 taxonomic groups (ranging from microbes to mesofauna) is primarily stochastic, suggesting that neutral processes are prominent drivers of the assembly of these communities at this scale. We also identify aluminium, topography and plant species identity as weak, yet significant drivers of soil richness and community composition of bacteria, protists and to a lesser extent fungi. Finally, we show that body size, which determines the scale at which an organism perceives its environment, predicted the community assembly across taxonomic groups, with soil mesofauna assemblages being more stochastic than microbial ones. These results suggest that the relative contribution of neutral processes and environmental selection to community assembly directly depends on body size. Body size is hence an important determinant of community assembly rules at the scale of the ecological community in tropical soils and should be accounted for in spatial models of tropical soil food webs.},

Potential mechanisms for the frequently observed litter-diversity effects on mass loss and nitrogen dynamics include fungi-driven nutrient transfer among litter species, inhibition or stimulation of microorganisms by specific litter compounds, and positive feedback of soil fauna due to greater habitat and food diversity. Theory predicts positive effects of microbial diversity that result from functional niche complementarity, but the few existing experiments provide conflicting results. Microbial succession with shifting enzymatic capabilities enhances decomposition, whereas antagonistic interactions among fungi that compete for similar resources slow litter decay. Soil-fauna diversity manipulations indicate that the number of trophic levels, species identity, and the presence of keystone species have a strong impact on decomposition, whereas the importance of diversity within functional groups is not clear at present. In conclusion, litter species and decomposer diversity can significantly influence carbon and nutrient turnover rates; however, no general or predictable pattern has emerged. Proposed mechanisms for diversity effects need confirmation and a link to functional traits for a comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity interacts with decomposition processes and the consequences of ongoing biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning.},

The specific goal was the identification of ``reference'' states for soil sustainability and ecosystem functioning in grazed vs. ungrazed sites. Methodology/Principal Findings: Bacterial cells were counted by fluorescent staining and combined direct microscopy and automatic image analysis; invertebrates (nematodes, mites, insects, oligochaetes) were sampled and their body size measured individually to allow allometric scaling. Numerical allometry analyses food webs by a direct comparison of weight averages of components and thus might characterize the detrital soil food webs of our 135 sites regardless of taxonomy. Sharp differences in the frequency distributions are shown. Overall higher biomasses of invertebrates occur in grasslands, and all larger soil organisms differed remarkably. Conclusions/Significance: Strong statistical evidence supports a hypothesis explaining from an allometric perspective how the faunal biomass distribution and the energetic flux are affected by livestock, nutrient availability and land use. Our aim is to propose faunal biomass flux and biomass distribution as quantitative descriptors of soil community composition and function, and to illustrate the application of these allometric indicators to soil systems.},

  abstract = {We studied the effects of land use change from grassland to Eucalyptus spp. plantation on macro and mesofauna soil food webs in two sites in the Rolling Pampas. We expected to find differences in the parameters that characterize the structure of soil food webs, as the implantation of Eucalyptus implies changes in the characteristics of the resources and the microhabitat conditions. We also expected to find differences in the communities in terms of diversity, abundance, and species present. The treatments were: grasslands; 10-year-old Eucalyptus plantations and 20-year-old Eucalyptus plantations. Seasonal samplings were performed for the extraction of soil fauna in winter, spring, summer and autumn. For the analysis of food webs, we worked with ``trophic species'': groups of organisms that have the same prey and the same predators. A total of 25 food webs were laid out using bibliographical information of feeding habits from the identified taxa. From each food web, we obtained a predator overlap graph, in which the consumers that share the same source or prey are linked by an arrow. In addition, the Shannon-Wiener index was calculated. We found that trophic species densities were different among the treatments: communities from grassland and the younger plantations were dominated by earthworms and other secondary decomposers, while the community in the older plantation showed a greater contribution of primary decomposers (Shymphyla, Isopoda and Diplopoda). No significant differences between treatments were found in the parameters that characterize the structure of soil food webs, i.e. connections number, number of trophic species nor connectivity. However, the diversity of the community was lower in the youngest plantations than in the other treatments, and it shows evidence of compartmentalization in the predator overlap graphs. Our findings suggest that the meso and macrofauna communities in the 10-years-old plantations represent a transition between the communities from grasslands and the oldest plantations. We conclude that the effects of forestation with Eucalyptus on soil fauna communities are evident through changes in functional groups rather than changes in the parameters that characterize the structure of soil food webs.},

  abstract = {In community ecology, trait-based approaches have been strongly recommended in recent years to understand the responses of community functions against environmental changes. Trait-based approaches have been used to solve the mechanistic rules in the relationship between soil animal communities and environmental change. However, databases of functional traits of soil animals are still lacking. Collembola is one of the most abundant and diverse group in land ecosystems, with more than 400 identified species in Japan. This dataset provides taxonomic information, geographic, habitat distributions, and 13 morphological trait items of 407 species of Japanese Collembola: described in Japanese literature. The workshop of Japanese Collembola, supported by the Japanese Society of Soil Zoology, summarized the taxonomy for the Japanese Collembola species. The dataset presented here is mainly based on their work. The spatial coverage of this dataset is in the land area of Japan. Suborder, superfamily, family, subfamily, genus, and species names, as well as common Japanese names, are listed in this paper. The species distributions of Japanese Collembola in each global ecozone and in each area within Japan were described. Habitat preference for soil, cave, seashore, and tree trunk habitats were recorded. The 13 morphological traits of Collembola species, which are body length; body weight of adult individual; body form; antenna length; furca length; body pigmentation; pairs of ocelli (eyes); post-antennal organ (PAO); pseudocelli; body scale; anal spine; mandible; and molar plate are listed in this dataset. These 13 morphological traits in this dataset are covered the most of trait items which have been internationally used in Collembola study. Trait-based studies of Collembola have mainly been for European species, most of which are not found in Japan or East Asia. These datasets may provide an important first step to incorporating community data from the Asian region to the trait-based global ecology. Data files are stored in the Ecological Research Data Archives (ERDP-2019-03).}

  abstract = {Indirect measures of soil invertebrate body mass M based on equations relating the latter to body length (l) are becoming increasingly used due to the required painstaking laboratory work and the technical difficulties involved in obtaining some thousands of reliable weight estimates for animals that can be very small. The implicit assumption of such equations is that dM/dV {$\frac{1}{4}$} d, where V is body volume and d is a constant density value. Classical Euclidean scaling implies that Vpl3pM. One may thus derive M from l when the latter can provide a good estimate of V and the assumption of a constant d is respected. In invertebrates, equations relating weight to length indicate that the power model always provides the best fit. However, authors only focused on the empirical estimation of slopes linking the body mass to the length measure variables, sometimes fitting exponential and linear models that are not theoretically grounded. This paper explicates how power laws derive from fundamental Euclidean scaling and describes the expected allometric exponents under the above assumptions. Based on the classical Euclidean scaling theory, an equivalent sphere is defined as a theoretical sphere with a volume equal to that of the organism whose body mass must be estimated. The illustrated application to a data set on soil oribatid mites helps clarify all these issues. Lastly, a general procedure for more precise estimation of M from V and d is suggested.},

Hemileius suramericanus (Hammer 1958) is an oribatid mite broadly distributed in the Neotropical Region. We studied the variation in male and female length and width, and in egg number in gravid females, in adults of H. suramericanus from Celtis tala wood patches and surrounding grassland. Samples were taken from soils of two different sized patches of a natural forest of Celtis tala and the grassland area (Pastizal) in the Estancia Nahuel Ruc{\'a} , Mar Chiquita District, Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. In each patch two zones were considered: center and periphery where, litter cover and mechanical resistance, as an estimator of soil compaction, were measured in addition to H. suramericanus population parameters. Females of H. suramericanus were bigger than males in general. Females from the grassland were narrower than those found in the forest patches. Males from the grassland were the smallest. The modal number of eggs per female were two in the bigger patch, and zero in Pastizal and the periphery of the patch smaller. Soil compaction was greater in the grassland than in the forest patches. We propose that litter cover and soil compaction can be factors that determine body size and fecundity, mainly through its effect on food availability.},

This chapter lays out a powerful approach to answering this question, based on the concepts of a regional species pool and environmental filters. The species pool is the set of species that could potentially colonize a local site or community. Of these potential colonists, some species are limited in their ability to disperse to site, some are limited by their ability to survive the abiotic environment, and some are limited by their interactions with other species. These ``filters'' act individually or in concert, and the functional traits of species determine their success in passing through these filters to colonize a local site. There is growing empirical evidence that both abiotic and biotic processes select for specific functional traits. Focusing on the functional traits of species may lead to rules of community assembly that are general and help unify a variety of more specific theories.},

However, because densities of gastropods in both the litter and underlying soil can reach 1607/m2, our results suggest that published values for total animal biomass (4.9 g/m2)and caloric energy (lo4 cal/m2)in boreal forest ecosystems are underestimated.},

Very different types of scaling have been studied, based on either individuals or species. The individual size distribution (ISD) describes the distribution of individual-organism body masses regardless of taxonomy, and contains the same information as the abundance spectrum. Focusing instead on species, the local size--density relationship (LSDR) plots population densities vs. mean body masses of species. The distribution of species mean body masses (the species-mean-size distribution, SMSD) is also important but previously little studied in webs. We here combine and formalize theory of several authors to predict: how these three descriptions are related; the forms of the LSDR and ISD; and variation in scaling among webs. We describe empirically the SMSDs of two pelagic, one estuarine, and 146 soil webs by power laws and generalizations. We test theory and find it broadly validated.},

Here, a stochastic individual-based model for the dynamics of size spectra is described, based on birth, growth, and death of individuals, using simple assumptions about feeding behavior. It is shown that the deterministic limit derived from the stochastic process is a partial differential equation previously used to describe the dynamics of size spectra. The equation has two classes of dynamics in the long term. The first is a steady state. A derivation under simple mass-balance assumptions shows that, at steady state, the linear size spectrum relating log abundance to log mass has a slope of approximately -1, similar to that often observed in natural size spectra. The second class of dynamics, not previously described, is a traveling-wave solution in which waves move along the size spectrum from small to large body size. Traveling waves become more likely when predators prefer prey much smaller than themselves and when they are specialized in the range of prey body sizes consumed. Wavelength depends on the size of prey relative to the size of predator, and wave speed depends on how fast mass moves through the spectrum.},

We review the main features and state of the art developments in the domain of continuous size-spectrum models. The community spectrum emerges from a balance between size-selective predation, growth and biomass dissipation. Further to these basic components, reproduction and various causes of mortality have been introduced in recent studies to increase the model's realism or simply close the mass budget of the spectrum. These different processes affect the stability of the spectrum and affect the predictions of the size-spectrum models. A few models have also introduced a representation of life-history traits in the community size-spectrum. This allows accounting for the diversity of energy pathways in food webs and for the fact that metabolism is both size- and species-specific. The community-level metabolism therefore depends on the species composition of the community. The size-spectrum's regularity at the community level can serve as a conceptual basis for building theories of marine ecosystems' functioning. It is also used as indicator of anthropogenic and natural disturbances. The mechanistic nature of size-spectrum models as well as their simple and aggregated representation of complex systems makes them good candidates as a strategic management tool. For instance, for testing the impact of different fishing management actions or for projecting marine ecosystem's states under various climate change scenarios.},

  abstract = {In terms of species richness, arthropods may represent as much as 85\% of the soil fauna. They comprise a large proportion of the meso- and macrofauna of the soil. Within the litter/soil system, five groups are chiefly represented: Isopoda, Myriapoda, Insecta, Acari, and Collembola, the latter two being by far the most abundant and diverse. Arthropods function on two of the three broad levels of organization of the soil food web: they are plant litter transformers or ecosystem engineers. Litter transformers fragment, or comminute, and humidify ingested plant debris, which is deposited in feces for further decomposition by micro-organisms, and foster the growth and dispersal of microbial populations. Large quantities of annual litter input may be processed (e.g., up to 60\% by termites). The comminuted plant matter in feces presents an increased surface area to attack by micro-organisms, which, through the process of mineralization, convert its organic nutrients into simpler, inorganic compounds available to plants. Ecosystem engineers alter soil structure, mineral and organic matter composition, and hydrology. The burrowing by arthropods, particularly the subterranean network of tunnels and galleries that comprise termite and ant nests, improves soil porosity to provide adequate aeration and water-holding capacity below ground, facilitate root penetration, and prevent surface crusting and erosion of topsoil. Also, the movement of particles from lower horizons to the surface by ants and termites aids in mixing the organic and mineral fractions of the soil. The feces of arthropods are the basis for the formation of soil aggregates and humus, which physically stabilize the soil and increase its capacity to store nutrients.},

  abstract = {Soil is an immense habitat for diverse organisms across the tree of life, but just how many organisms live in soil is surprisingly unknown. Previous efforts to enumerate soil biodiversity consider only certain types of organisms (e.g., animals) or report values for diverse groups without partitioning species that live in soil versus other habitats. Here, we reviewed the biodiversity literature to show that soil is likely home to 59 {\textpm} 15\% of the species on Earth. We therefore estimate an approximately two times greater soil biodiversity than previous estimates, and we include representatives from the simplest (microbial) to most complex (mammals) organisms. Enchytraeidae have the greatest percentage of species in soil (98.6\%), followed by fungi (90\%), Plantae (85.5\%), and Isoptera (84.2\%). Our results demonstrate that soil is the most biodiverse singular habitat. By using this estimate of soil biodiversity, we can more accurately and quantitatively advocate for soil organismal conservation and restoration as a central goal of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {Capturing the complexity of soil life for soil quality assessments is one of the most challenging paradoxes of contemporary soil science. Soil biota perform a plethora of processes that are fundamental to soil quality. As the concept of soil quality developed, so have the attempts to integrate soil biological measurements into monitoring schemes from field to regional scale. To date, however, soil science has not yet succeeded to provide flexible yet objective biological indicator methods to assess soil multifunctionality, customised to the user's context. We present an integrative framework and elucidate the who and how of soil multifunctionality. The framework encompasses the current scientific understanding of the role of soil biota in supporting the many soil processes that underly soil quality. We specified these relationships for four soil functions (Carbon and Climate Regulation, Water Regulation and Purification, Nutrient Cycling, and Disease and Pest Regulation). We identify challenges often encountered in soil quality assessment and monitoring schemes and discuss how the framework can be applied to provide a flexible selection tool. Soil quality assessments are conducted in different contexts. As assessment objectives range from mechanistic understanding, to functional land management and large spatial scale monitoring so will the practical and logistical constraints for method selection vary. Biological assessments need to move beyond the quest for a one-size-fits-all minimum dataset, and adopt a more nuanced selection approach founded in soil biology. We stress that biological attributes should not be considered in isolation but alongside soil chemical and physical attributes, as well as management and environmental contextualisation. The presented framework offers a structure to further quantify, understand and communicate the who and how of soil biology in defining multifunctionality.},

  abstract = {The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a `multichannel' food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess `trophic multifunctionality' (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity--ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground--aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.},

We first deal with resistance and resilience against abiotic disturbance and stress. There is evidence that soil biodiversity does confer stability to stress and disturbance, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. It appears to depend on the kind of stress and disturbance and on the combination of stress and disturbance effects. Alternatively, community structure may play a role. Both possible explanations will guide further research. We then discuss biotic stress. There is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers protection against soil-borne disease, but crop and soil type and management also play a role. Their relative importance as well as the role of biodiversity in multitrophic interactions warrant further study. Henceforth, we focus on the effects of plant and soil biodiversity on nutrient and water use efficiencies as important ecological functions in agroecosystems. The available evidence suggests that mycorrhizal diversity positively contributes to nutrient and, possibly, water use efficiency. Soil fauna effects on nutrient and water use efficiencies are also apparent, but diversity effects may be indirect, through effects on soil structure. We present a conceptual diagram relating plant and soil biodiversity with soil structure and water and nutrient use efficiencies as a framework for future studies. We then consider how cropping systems design and management are interrelated and how management options might be interfaced with farmers' knowledge in taking management decisions. Finally, we attempt to express some economic benefits of soil biodiversity to society as part of a wider strategy of conserving and using agrobiodiversity.},

Our findings indicate that earthworms contribute to roughly 6.5\% of global grain (maize, rice, wheat, barley) production and 2.3\% of legume production, equivalent to over 140 million metric tons annually. The earthworm contribution is especially notable in the global South, where earthworms contribute 10\% of total grain production in Sub-Saharan Africa and 8\% in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our findings suggest that earthworms are important drivers of global food production and that investment in agroecological policies and practices to support earthworm populations and overall soil biodiversity could contribute greatly to sustainable agricultural goals.},

  abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems -- such as communities -- through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with -- what we believe to be -- their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Other such types include habitat modification, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few ({$<$}3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model. This approach provides a path forward for incorporating non-trophic interactions in traditional food web models and offers a new perspective on tackling ecological complexity that should stimulate both theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the patterns and dynamics of diverse species interactions in nature.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity research typically focuses on species richness and has often neglected interactions, either by assuming that such interactions are homogeneously distributed or by addressing only the interactions between a pair of species or a few species at a time. In contrast, a network approach provides a powerful representation of the ecological interactions among species and highlights their global interdependence. Understanding how the responses of pairwise interactions scale to entire assemblages remains one of the great challenges that must be met as society faces global ecosystem change.}

Despite the tremendous diversity of organisms that soil food webs harbor, we still know surprisingly little about the role of biodiversity in influencing the processes and services provided by soil food webs. To guide future research in this area, we outline a conceptual framework linking hierarchical levels of soil biodiversity to ecosystem processes and services. Here, we distinguish among different hierarchical levels of diversity: trophic, functional, taxonomic and genetic diversity. We conclude that the levels of food web diversity that matter most vary with the processes or services considered, with functional trait diversity being the most universally influential level of diversity. Increased research emphasis on manipulating diversity across hierarchical levels of biodiversity organization, with an explicit focus on the functional role of the component species, is critical for enhancing our understanding of the role of soil food web diversity in driving ecosystem processes and services.},

One important use of these resources is agricultural production. Agricultural production is critical to supporting a healthy society; however, when we mismanage soil systems for agricultural production or misapply new technologies, we reduce the productivity of the soil. Soil degradation is found throughout the world, often created by humans' lack of understanding of soil science, a lack of soil and water conservation practices, a lack of conservation policies, and/or social and economic constraints. In some instances, poor or uninformed policies have exacerbated the deterioration of an important soil resource: this is the case for the Argentinean Pampas, a superb temperate agricultural land in the Southern Hemisphere. REGIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AND HISTORY The Pampas region, located in the south cone of South America (33{$^\circ$}-35{$^\circ$} S, 62{$^\circ$}-64{$^\circ$} W), covers about 60 Mha (148 Mac) and is part of one of the largest prairies of the world. This fertile area is suitable for temperate field crops and livestock and is the backbone of Argentinean agriculture. It is also where the main cities are concentrated{\dots}},

  abstract = {The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.},

In a series of real food webs from native and agricultural soils, the strengths of the interactions were found to be patterned in a way that is important to ecosystem stability. The patterning consisted of the simultaneous occurrence of strong "top down" effects at lower trophic levels and strong "bottom up" effects at higher trophic levels. As the patterning resulted directly from the energetic organization of the food webs, the results show that energetics and community structure govern ecosystem stability by imposing stabilizing patterns of interaction strengths.}

Accordingly, we propose the quantification of energy fluxes in food webs as a powerful, universal tool for understanding ecosystem functioning in multitrophic systems spanning different ecological scales. Although the concept of energy flux in food webs is not novel, its application to BEF research remains virtually untapped, providing a framework to foster new discoveries into the determinants of ecosystem functioning in complex systems.},

This mathematical relationship between complexity and local stability ignited a debate that has populated ecological literature for more than three decades. Here we show that, when species interact as predators and prey, systems as complex as the ones observed in nature can still be stable. Moreover, stability is highly robust to perturbations of interaction strength, and is largely a property of structure driven by predator--prey loops with the stability of these small modules cascading into that of the whole network. These results apply to empirical food webs and models that mimic the structure of natural systems as well. These findings are also robust to the inclusion of other types of ecological links, such as mutualism and interference competition, as long as consumer--resource interactions predominate. These considerations underscore the influence of food web structure on ecological dynamics and challenge the current view of interaction strength and long cycles as main drivers of stability in natural communities.},

  abstract = {Understanding how changes in biodiversity will impact the stability and functioning of ecosystems is a central challenge in ecology. Food web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remain problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases. We developed a generalization of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady-state system (Hunt et al., ); the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each node's losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/fluxweb/index.html). We also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology (Brown, Gillooly, Allen, Savage, \& West, ; to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e., body masses and species groups---e.g., plants, animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production. The primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g., predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state. Overall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.},

The AM fungal diversity of 3 agricultural exploitations located in the Pampa Ondulada region (Argentina) was assessed by using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing and morphological (based on spore traits) approaches. Two kinds of soil managements are found in these sites: agronomic and non-agronomic. A total of 188 molecular operational taxonomic units and 29 morphological species of AM fungi were identified. No effect of soil management on AM richness was detected. AM fungal communities were more diverse and equitable in the absence of agronomic management. In contrast, the results on {$\beta$}-diversity varied according to the methodology used. We concluded that agronomic management of soil has a negative effect on AM fungal community biodiversity in the Pampa Ondulada region. We also conclude that both methodologies complement each other in the study of AM fungal ecology. This study greatly improved the knowledge about AM fungi in South America where the molecular diversity of AM fungi was practically unknown.},

The application of different management practices to soil impacts edaphic mite populations by altering the organic inputs and by influencing the soil microhabitat. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the influence of three different land management practices on soil mite density in temperate agroecosystems of C{\'o}rdoba, Argentina, in comparison with a natural soil. Standard abiotic soil properties were also analyzed. Six samples per plot and per sampling date were taken at bimonthly intervals from August 1999 to June 2001. A gradient of increasing soil degradation was evident in physical, chemical and physicochemical soil properties from natural to agricultural plots. Total mite density decreased as soil cultivation increased. However, different responses to land management were observed when comparing the different suborders of mites. Oribatida and Mesostigmata were more sensitive to the agricultural practices than Prostigmata and Astigmata. Densities of the last two suborders seemed to be unaffected by soil cultivation in some periods. Oribatida, Mesostigmata and pooled mite density showed a hump-backed relationship with management intensity, with a maximum in the cattle management. It is concluded that the influence of soil cultivation on soil mites as a whole was negative, with more intensively managed systems tending to reduce mite density, although different suborders were differentially affected by agricultural intensification. We suggest that the reduction of total mite, Oribatida and Mesostigmata densities in the high-input managements is mainly explained by the perturbations produced by conventional agricultural practices and by environmental soil conditions present in the intensively managed sites that were unfavorable for these groups of mites. The implication of the changes reported in mite abundances on soil processes is discussed.},

These organisms have pivotal roles in soil ecosystem functions, such as the breakdown and decomposition of organic matter, the dispersal of bacterial and fungal spores and biological habitat transformation. These functions, in turn, contribute to broader ecosystem services like carbon and nutrient cycling, soil organic matter regulation and both chemical and physical soil fertility.This study provides morphological data pertaining to a range of soil organism sizes, specifically in Argiudol soils subjected to varying levels of agricultural activity in the Rolling Pampas Region, one of the world's most extensive and fertile plains.The primary focus is on soil microarthropods---namely, Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails)---with a body width of less than 2 mm. These organisms constitute the majority of life in the intricate soil pore network. Additionally, the study documents species of earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitelata), recognised as ecosystem engineers for their ability to create physical channels in the soil matrix and to distribute organic matter. Moreover, the study includes measurements of morphological traits of soil-dwelling "macrofauna" (organisms with a body width greater than 2 mm), which are also implicated in various soil ecosystem functions. These include population regulation by apex predators, organic matter decomposition, biogenic structure formation, nutrient mobilisation and herbivory.In this paper, we report both the geographical locations and individual measurements of key morphological traits for over 7,000 specimens, covering a range of soil-dwelling organisms. These include springtails (Entognatha, Collembola), mites (Arachnida, Acari), earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitellata) and additional soil macrofauna. All specimens were collected from typical Argiudol soils located in three distinct agricultural systems characterised by varying levels of land-use intensity.

  abstract = {Here we introduce the Soil BON Foodweb Team, a cross-continental collaborative network that aims to monitor soil animal communities and food webs using consistent methodology at a global scale. Soil animals support vital soil processes via soil structure modification, consumption of dead organic matter, and interactions with microbial and plant communities. Soil animal effects on ecosystem functions have been demonstrated by correlative analyses as well as in laboratory and field experiments, but these studies typically focus on selected animal groups or species at one or few sites with limited variation in environmental conditions. The lack of comprehensive harmonised large-scale soil animal community data including microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna, in conjunction with related soil functions, microbial communities, and vegetation, limits our understanding of biological interactions in soil systems and how these interactions affect ecosystem functioning. To provide such data, the Soil BON Foodweb Team invites researchers worldwide to use a common methodology to address six long-term goals: (1) to collect globally representative harmonised data on soil micro-, meso-, and macrofauna communities, (2) to describe key environmental drivers of soil animal communities and food webs, (3) to assess the efficiency of conservation approaches for the protection of soil animal communities, (4) to describe soil food webs and their association with soil functioning globally, (5) to establish a global research network for soil biodiversity monitoring and collaborative projects in related topics, (6) to reinforce local collaboration networks and expertise and support capacity building for soil animal research around the world. In this paper, we describe the vision of the global research network and the common sampling protocol to assess soil animal communities and advocate for the use of standard methodologies across observational and experimental soil animal studies. We will use this protocol to conduct soil animal assessments and reconstruct soil food webs at sites associated with the global soil biodiversity monitoring network, Soil BON, allowing us to assess linkages among soil biodiversity, vegetation, soil physico-chemical properties, climate, and ecosystem functions. In the present paper, we call for researchers especially from countries and ecoregions that remain underrepresented in the majority of soil biodiversity assessments to join us. Together we will be able to provide science-based evidence to support soil biodiversity conservation and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.},

After half filling with water, the mixture is well stirred and then allowed to stand for about 30 sec. before decanting through a 270- or 325-mesh sieve. This is done twice and the residue on the sieve collected in a beaker; the remaining soil is discarded. The residue is transferred to two 50 ml. centrifuge tubes and spun for 4 to 5 min. at about 1, 750 r.p.m. The supernatant liquid is then poured off and a sugar solution added (1 lb. cane sugar, l litre water), thoroughly mixing sugar solution and sediment; the tubes are spun for 0.5 to 1 min. The supernatant containing the nematodes is poured on to a 325-mesh sieve. After rinsing the sugar away with water the nematodes are ready for use. The process is said to recover all free-living nematodes in excellent shape and with infective potential.}

Microbial anabolic metabolism in soil was stimulated by glucose addition. Simultaneous addition of eukaryote and/or prokaryote-specific antibiotics, which inhibit anabolic metabolism, fractionated the microbial biomass on the basis of selective respiratory inhibition. The improvements proposed here are that: (1) the glucose and antibiotic(s) are dissolved in water prior to addition to soil (the ratio of glucose and antibiotic(s) solution to dry weight of soil being 2 ml:l g); (2) maximal respiratory inhibition is required for each antibiotic; and (3) soil + glucose and antibiotic(s) solution are incubated for 3.5 h prior to the assay. The improved selective respiratory inhibition technique gave eukaryote:prokaryote (fungal:(discrete bacteria + actinomycete)) respiratory ratios of 1 for two soils under pasture, but failed to work on an arable soil. Mycelial (fungal + actinomycete):discrete bacterial biomass C ratios derived by the biovolume procedure were 1 and 2 for the soils under pasture and 3 for the arable soil.},

  abstract = {1 Little consensus has been reached as to general features of spatial variation in beta diversity, a fundamental component of species diversity. This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult. 2 We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties. 3 Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between `broad sense' measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and `narrow sense' measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable. 4 We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted a, b and c) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.},

  abstract = {Soil fauna significantly contributes to litter decomposition and carbon cycle but it has been neglected in most soil ecosystem models in which biological activity is limited to microbial activity. Soil food webs have been empirically described as the addition of a micro-food web relying on microbial production and of a macro-food web relying on detritivorous invertebrates, which contrasts with the linear producer-consumer-top predator view of food webs usually considered in food web theory. To understand the consequences of such a structure on ecosystem functioning, we built two versions of a dynamic bioenergetic model harbouring either a multichannel structure, in which different resources and consumers generate distinct energy channels, or a purely size-dependent trophic structure seen here as null model. We parametrised these models based on published literature and compared their outputs to independent worldwide soil ecosystem data. We found that the multichannel structure successfully predicts the empirical relationship between body sizes and trophic levels in soils. It also correctly predicts the biomass distribution among the main invertebrate trophic groups, although it underestimates the microbial biomass. Both models predict similar carbon flows. They also predict a major contribution of microbivores (e.g. protists and nematodes) to the total ecosystem respiration contrary to previous model-based estimations. This underlines the potentially high impact of microfauna on the carbon cycle in spite of its low abundance. Our model represents a milestone to link the trophic dynamics of soil fauna to ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles.},

  abstract = {Food web topologies depict the community structure as distributions of feeding interactions across populations. Although the soil ecosystem provides important functions for aboveground ecosystems, data on complex soil food webs is notoriously scarce, most likely due to the difficulty of sampling and characterizing the system. To fill this gap we assembled the complex food webs of 48 forest soil communities. The food webs comprise 89 to 168 taxa and 729 to 3344 feeding interactions. The feeding links were established by combining several molecular methods (stable isotope, fatty acid and molecular gut content analyses) with feeding trials and literature data. First, we addressed whether soil food webs (n = 48) differ significantly from those of other ecosystem types (aquatic and terrestrial aboveground, n = 77) by comparing 22 food web parameters. We found that our soil food webs are characterized by many omnivorous and cannibalistic species, more trophic chains and intraguild-predation motifs than other food webs and high average and maximum trophic levels. Despite this, we also found that soil food webs have a similar connectance as other ecosystems, but interestingly a higher link density and clustering coefficient. These differences in network structure to other ecosystem types may be a result of ecosystem specific constraints on hunting and feeding characteristics of the species that emerge as network parameters at the food-web level. In a second analysis of land-use effects, we found significant but only small differences of soil food web structure between different beech and coniferous forest types, which may be explained by generally strong selection effects of the soil that are independent of human land use. Overall, our study has unravelled some systematic structures of soil food-webs, which extends our mechanistic understanding how environmental characteristics of the soil ecosystem determine patterns at the community level.},

  abstract = {There is an increasing concern for the conservation of soil biodiversity and its ecosystem functions. In this context, it is crucial to comprehend the typical response times of the community (meso and macrofauna) to disturbances associated with different land uses. If we consider a disturbance as some degree of disorganization produced by an input of energy into the system, we realise that the issue is how the surplus of energy is dissipated, and with at what efficiency. Emerging properties of a community (diversity, resilience, stability) are affected by a cascade of processes that act at different spatial and temporal scales. To diagnose disturbance effects, it is necessary to use new tools of observation. One of these tools is the analysis of food webs that clearly shows the relationships among species and energy fluxes. We present here an example of the use of the food web approach to study the effects of foresting a naturalized pasture of the humid Argentinean Pampa with exotic species of trees (Eucalyptus camadulensis and Populus nigra). We show that the basic architecture of food webs remains similar under different treatments (related to the input of new detritus source) in a short time (60 days). However, the proposed approach in this study enables to design a simple decision scheme to formulate hypotheses about possible effects of stronger disturbances.},

Hunt and colleagues in 1987, the field diversified over the last two decades across ecosystem and community ecology, empirical and theoretical approaches, network and energy flux analyses. Here we reflect on the history, status, and trends in soil food-web research and identify major perspectives and synthesis directions. After briefly reviewing modelling approaches, structure, and quantification of functioning, we distinguish modern trends in tools that can streamline food-web research, a need for proper empirical validation, collaborative approaches to push the field forward, and conclude with application perspectives. In the light of increasing data availability and public awareness about soil biodiversity, we call for synthesis across multiple dimensions of soil food-web research (e.g. different methodologies and disciplines, various spatiotemporal scales, multiple trophic levels and phyla of life), integrating the soil food-web approach to biodiversity and environmental studies, and making it more accessible to a wider community of scientists.},

Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures (`insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

Accurate knowledge of trophic relations is central for the understanding of ecosystem dynamics, which in turn, is essential for food web stability analyzes and the development of sustainable practices. There is a rapid growth in the knowledge on how belowground biodiversity regulates the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although, the available information about trophic relationships is hard to find and fragmented. Most of the information available worldwide about the food resources of soil microarthropods suggested that out of 3105 hits of initial research on this aspect only a total of 196 published works related particular species, genera, and families to particular trophic resources, the majority of them dealing with soils of the Palearctic region. From the 196 publications we extracted 3009 records relating specific taxonomic groups to their trophic resources, 20 percent mention saprophytic fungi as a food resource, 16 percent cite microfauna, 11 percent mention bacteria, 10 percent litter and 8 percent cite Springtails. The available information was highly skewed, the 73.71 percent comes from Acari, and within these, 50.62 percent correspond just to Sarcoptiformes. The literature on Collembola is very scarce and most of the information is on arthropleona. The review also highlights that available research on the use of trophic resources comes from European sites and the information on this aspect from other parts of the soils of the world is still at large but unknown.},

While grassland ecosystem responses to grazing have been extensively studied, few studies have focused on the effects of aboveground herbivores on belowground diversity and functions. In this work, we quantified effects of grazing on the structure, function and dynamic stability of soil food webs. We sampled a long-term grazing manipulation in a semi-arid shortgrass steppe (USA Great Plains) at sites showing contrasting soil textures. Treatments included native steppe plots that have been moderately grazed since 1939 paired with plots totally protected from grazing since 1996. We sampled our plots for soil C and N, and for soil biota, separated microbes and micro- and mesofauna in trophic functional groups and defined trophic relationships. We used models to estimate carbon and nitrogen mineralization, energy flow throughout the food web, interaction strengths between trophic groups at steady-state and, eventually, asymptotic (near-equilibrium or local) stability (Moore and de Ruiter, 2012). Soil food web response to grazing depended on soil texture and organic matter content. In our food webs, most energy flowed through the fungal and bacterial detritus-based channels (sensu Moore and Hunt, 1988). There was a clear asymmetry between the amount of energy flowing through each of the two channels and, the higher this asymmetry, the higher was food web stability. Stability was affected by both grazing and soil properties (increased under grazing in high clay soils with high organic matter content but decreased in less organic loam sandy soils), and positively associated with soil organic matter content. Overall, we found that the carbon flow through the soil food web of the shortgrass steppe is responsive to grazing in ways that altered stability and that structural, functional, and dynamic attributes are sensitive parameters for evaluating soil response to land use under changing scenarios.},

  abstract = {To understand the dynamics of natural species communities, a major challenge is to quantify the relationship between their assembly, stability, and underlying food web structure. To this end, two complementary aspects of food web structure can be related to community stability: sign structure, which refers to the distributions of trophic links irrespective of interaction strengths, and interaction strength structure, which refers to the distributions of interaction strengths with or without consideration of sign structure. In this paper, using data from a set of relatively well documented community food webs, I show that natural communities generally exhibit a sign structure that renders their stability sensitive to interaction strengths. Using a Lotka--Volterra type population dynamical model, I then show that in such communities, individual consumer species with high values of a measure of their total biomass acquisition rate, which I term ``weighted generality'', tend to undermine community stability. Thus consumer species' trophic modules (a species and all its resource links) should be ``selected'' through repeated immigrations and extinctions during assembly into configurations that increase the probability of stable coexistence within the constraints of the community's trophic sign structure. The presence of such constraints can be detected by the incidence and strength of certain non-random structural characteristics. These structural signatures of dynamical constraints are readily measurable, and can be used to gauge the importance of interaction-driven dynamical constraints on communities during and after assembly in natural communities.},

These complexities include nutrient recycling, omnivory (consuming more than one prey item) and multiple reticulated channels through which energy and resources flow. Increasing evidence in real and modeled food webs suggests a critical complexity of all webs is the presence of multi-channel feeding. Multi-channel feeding, or multi-channel omnivory, occurs when a consumer feeds across two energy channels: such as a consumer that eats both roots and detritus or bacteria and fungi. As growing empirical research has documented that multi-channel omnivores are the most common type of consumer in real webs, modeling studies have also highlighted that such omnivory can be stabilizing. Here I briefly review the evolving paradigm of multi-channel feeding in food webs and outline several major areas of research that could advance predictions of how common multi-channel feeding should be in soil food webs and its impacts on stability and trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method was modified and adapted to measure fungal, bacterial and total microbial contributions to glucose-induced respiration and the potentially active microbial biomass on decaying plant residues of differing composition. Decomposing residues from natural and agricultural ecosystems were chopped and sieved to include the {$>$} 1 mm fraction for routine SIR analyses on a continuous flow-through respiration system. SIR procedures were optimized for sample size (0.5--1.0g dry wt), glucose concentration (80mg g-1), antibiotic concentrations (16mg streptomycin g-1; 80 mg cycloheximide g-1), total solution volume (5 ml), antibiotic preincubation conditions (12 h at 4 C), and total assay time following glucose addition (2--3 h). Analyses of antibiotic selectivities for target populations were made from agar plate culture experiments with mixed residue-microbial populations under in vitro and in situ exposure to antibiotics. The results support those concentrations optimized by SIR and emphasize the importance of independent analysis of antibiotic selectivity. Measures of fungal, bacterial and total SIR ({$\mu$}g CO2-C g-1 dry residue h-1) were linearly correlated (P{$<$}0.001) with biovolume-derived estimates of total (r2 = 0.91) and FDA-active (r2 = 0.93) fungal biomass, bacterial biomass (r2 = 0.87) and total microbial biomass (r2 = 0.91), respectively. Fungal to bacterial SIR ratios (1.6:1 to 2.5:1) emphasize the dominance of fungi in the early stages of plant residue decay ({$\leq$} 3 weeks). Plant residue SIR rates were 38--600 times greater than those of soils. Biomass specific SIR rates from plant residues (72 ng CO2 -Ch-1 {$\mu$}g-1 biomass-C) were 5-- 6 times higher than those reported from soil SIR. These findings suggest both a larger microbial biomass as well as a much higher proportion of physiologically active microorganisms on plant residues as compared to soils.},

Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

We determined the biomass of bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes, the pore-size distribution, and the potential mineralization rates of C and N in grassland soils with different textures. Bacteria constituted by far the largest biomass pool. Fungi, protozoa and nematodes together comprised only 10\% of the total biomass. It was found that in loams and clays, most pores had diameters {$<$}0.2 {$\mu$}m and between 0.2 and 1.2 {$\mu$}m, whereas in sandy soils most pores had diameters from 6 to 30 and 30 to 90 {$\mu$}m. A close positive correlation was found between the bacterial biomass and the soil volume of pores with 0.2--1.2{$\mu$}m dia and between the biomass of nematodes and the soil volume of pores with 30--90 {$\mu$}m dia. The biomass of fungi and protozoa showed no relationship with a specific pore-size class. Bacterial activity [measured as the frequency of dividing-divided cells (FDDC); the number of viable cells; and the amount of CO2 produced per cell] were not affected by grazing intensity. The amount of N mineralized bacterium-1, however, was much higher in soils with a high grazing pressure of bacterivorous nematodes and flagellates than in soils with a low grazing pressure of these groups. This indicates that grazing of bacteria by bacterivorous nematodes and flagellates may considerably increase N mineralization. No relationship was found between the grazing pressure of amoebae and the amount of N mineralized bacterium-1.},

In studies of these processes soil ecologists often rely on `guilds' and `functional groups' as their basic unit of observation. Here, I evaluate the usefulness and limitations of this approach for understanding some of the above-mentioned processes. A simple conceptual model of ecological interactions in soil is presented. The plant has a central place in this model in that it both governs, and is a biological assessment of, the roles soil fauna play in ecosystem processes. The need for a quantitative model of ecological interactions in soil is discussed with reference to current modelling efforts of organic matter and food webs in soil.},

  abstract = {Size spectra are recommended tools for detecting the response of marine communities to fishing or to management measures. A size spectrum succinctly describes how a property, such as abundance or biomass, varies with body size in a community. Required data are often collected in binned form, such as numbers of individuals in 1 cm length bins. Numerous methods have been employed to fit size spectra, but most give biased estimates when tested on simulated data, and none account for the data's bin structure (breakpoints of bins). Here, we used 8 methods to fit an annual size-spectrum exponent, b, to an example data set (30 yr of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey). The methods gave conflicting conclusions regarding b declining (the size spectrum steepening) through time, and so any resulting advice to ecosystem managers will be highly dependent upon the method used. Using simulated data, we showed that ignoring the bin structure gives biased estimates of b, even for high-resolution data. However, our extended likelihood method, which explicitly accounts for the bin structure, accurately estimated b and its confidence intervals, even for coarsely collected data. We developed a novel visualisation method that accounts for the bin structure and associated uncertainty, provide recommendations concerning different data types and have created an R package (sizeSpectra) to reproduce all results and encourage use of our methods. This work is also relevant to wider applications where a power-law distribution (the underlying distribution for a size spectrum) is fitted to binned data.},

We illustrate our new approach, and relate it to previous approaches, by analyzing data from the pelagic community of a small lake, Tuesday Lake, in Michigan. Although many of the relationships we describe have been well studied individually, we are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. An overview of some of the results of the present study, with further theoretical extensions, has been published elsewhere (Cohen et al., 2003). Our new approach yields four major results. Though many patterns in the structure of an ecological community have been traditionally treated as independent, they are in fact connected. In at least one real ecosystem, many of these patterns are relatively robust after a major perturbation. Some of these patterns may be predictably consistent from one community to another. Locally, however, some community characteristics need not necessarily coincide with previously reported patterns for guilds or larger geographical scales. We describe our major findings under these headings: trivariate relation- ships (that is, relationships combining the food web, body size, and species abundance); bivariate relationships; univariate relationships; and the eVects of food web perturbation.},

  abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution---the part of the distribution representing large but rare events---and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov--Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

A large number of empirically based relationships describe biological rates as simple functions of body size; and other such relations predict the intrinsic rate of population growth, animal speed, animal density, territory size, prey size, physiology, and morphology. Such equations almost always exist for mammals and birds, often for other vertebrates and invertebrates, sometimes for protozoa, algae, and bacteria, and occasionally even for plants. There are too many organisms to measure all aspects of the biology of every species of population, so scientists must depend on generalizations. Body size relations represent our most extensive and powerful assemblage of generalizations, but they have never been organized for use in ecology. This book represents the largest single compilation of interspecific size relations, and instructs the reader on the use of these relationships; their comparison, combination, and criticism. Both strengths and weaknesses of our current knowledge are discussed in order to indicate the many possible directions for further research. This important volume will therefore provide a point of departure toward a new applied ecology, giving quantitative solutions to real questions.

It has been shown that conversion of rainforest into plantations erodes biodiversity, but further consequences for food-web structure and energetics of belowground communities remains little explored. We used a unique combination of stable isotope analysis and food-web energetics to analyze in a comprehensive way consequences of the conversion of rainforest into oil palm and rubber plantations on the structure of and channeling of energy through soil animal food webs in Sumatra, Indonesia. Across the animal groups studied, most of the taxa had lower litter-calibrated {$\Delta$}13C values in plantations than in rainforests, suggesting that they switched to freshly-fixed plant carbon ('fast' energy channeling) in plantations from the detrital C pathway ('slow' energy channeling) in rainforests. These shifts led to changes in isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness. However, earthworms as major detritivores stayed unchanged in their trophic niche and monopolized the detrital pathway in plantations, resulting in similar energetic metrics across land-use systems. Functional diversity metrics of soil food webs were associated with reduced amount of litter, tree density, and species richness in plantations, providing guidelines on how to improve the complexity of the structure of and channeling of energy through soil food webs. Our results highlight the strong restructuring of soil food webs with the conversion of rainforest into plantations threatening soil functioning and ecosystem stability in the long term.},

The duration of the immature stages and of the adult stage were determined. Food type greatly affected female fecundity and feeding capacity. Immature stages of H. vacua consumed in total an average of 13.6 eggs of M. domestica and 33.0 nymphs of R. echinopus, whereas each day throughout her life, the adult female consumed an average of 4.1 eggs of M. domestica and 13.23 nymphs of R. echinopus. Eggs of housefly were the most suitable diet, as it prolonged adult longevity (76.8 days) and increased female fecundity (1.3 eggs/female/day)., L'acarien pr\'edateur, Hypoaspis vacua (Michael) s'est developp\'e avec succ\'es depuis la larve jusqu'au stade adulte quand il s'alimentait sur des oeufs de la mouche domestique Musca domestica (L.) et des larves de l'acarien Rhizoglyphus echinopus (Fum. et Rob.) au laboratoire.

  abstract = {The interrelationships among collembolan feeding groups (FG), decomposition rates, microbial biomass, and forest successional stage were studied at three sites in Douglas-fir dominated stands on the dry leeward side of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Each site contained a basic suite (or chronosequence) of four stages of stand development: old-growth ({$>$}248 years), regeneration (7\textendash 9 years), immature (35\textendash 46 years), and mature (80\textendash 102 years). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify four collembolan feeding groups on the basis of gut contents. Three of the feeding groups (FG 1\textendash 3) were fungal-feeders, but differed from one another in the types of fungal material consumed. The last group (FG 4) comprised species that ingested particulate organic matter (POM). Significant positive correlations between microbial biomass and collembolan abundance were obtained for the fungal-feeding Collembola (FG 1\textendash 3), but not for the detritivorous FG 4. The proportional representation of collembolan species feeding on darkly pigmented fungi (FG 1) was reduced in the regeneration stands, where species feeding on particulate organic matter predominated. Over the 4 years of this study, the mass loss of decomposing wood chips in litterbags was not significantly influenced by the age of the forest in which the bags were placed. In contrast, the mass loss of needle litter was significantly reduced in regeneration stands. Multiple regressions based on the abundance of the different feeding groups of Collembola provided better estimates of the mass loss of decomposing litter or wood chips than did regressions based on total collembolan numbers.},

(3) The soil animal populations were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the two series of litter bags despite marked differences in the decomposition rates of the two leaf species. Evidence suggested that the soil animal populations in the bags were governed by non-nutritional properties of the litter.

  abstract = {Due to high abundance and feeding habits, invertebrates are of great importance for shaping microbial communities at the fine scale. Springtails (Collembola) that feed on fungal spores and mycelia may contribute to dispersal through carrying fungal propagules in their guts or on their appendages. The Collembola\textendash fungal associations are mainly investigated by microscopy or culturing techniques, which allow identify only fungi that have distinctive morphological characteristics or that can be cultured in~vitro. Here we identified the Collembola-associated fungi on the body surface and in the gut content using both culturing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. We studied three epigeic Collembola species found on the Norway spruce dominated forest stands throughout the vegetation period \textendash{} Entomobrya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens and Pogonognathellus longicornis. We discovered over 1200 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e. the proxies for species, based on 97\% sequence similarity of the ITS2 subregion of ribosomal DNA. Most of the fungi were saprotrophs, but we detected also mycorrhizal, parasitic and lichenized fungi. Season was the most important factor affecting fungal richness and composition, especially on body surface. Although the data matrix revealed significant effect of substrate, we were unable to detect the significant fungal community differences between body surface and gut samples of conspecifics. There were no significant differences among studied epigeic Collembola species in the preference for fungal diet. Our study demonstrates that collembolans associate with a broader range of fungi than previously observed and thus potentially play an important role in enhancing fungal colonization through dispersal activities.},

It reports on the feeding habit of 69 species-level taxa (39 newly observed; 30 from the literature) belonging to 36 genera and 16 families of Mesostigmata. Feeding observations were made in small laboratory arenas where mites were offered sympatric arthropods or cultured rhabditid nematodes, springtails and mites. Most species tested readily fed on nematodes and springtails and many attacked the nymphs of mesostigmatic mites. A few fed on the fluids of crushed or decomposing arthropods. As indicated by studies on other continents, our results support the hypothesis that many soil Mesostigmata, including both ground and canopy species, are generalist predators that feed on nematodes and a variety of arthropod prey. These findings also suggest that some Mesostigmata are opportunistic scavengers.},

The activity of three carbohydrases was measured, i.e. trehalase, cellulase and chitinase. Species were classified in feeding guilds based on the presence or absence of enzymatic activity. The majority of the samples analysed showed trehalase and cellulase activity, and indicate that Collembola commonly have the ability to digest cell walls of plants and algae, and the contents of fungal hyphae. Most of the species examined had chitinase activity, and are able to digest fungal cell walls. Based on the results, four feeding guilds were distinguished, i.e. herbo-fungivorous grazers (nine species), fungivorous grazers (two species), opportunistic herbofungivores (one species) and omnivore (one species). Five species could not be classified due to low number of samples. One more feeding guild was indicated if the levels of enzymatic activity within species were taken into account, i.e. fungivorous browsers. The results show that most species have the ability to digest the food items reported from gut content analyses. Between species, significant difference in specific enzymatic activity was recorded. These findings suggest that, together with information on feeding guilds, under field conditions the various species in the community differed in their food choice. It is hypothesised that a relationship exists between the mouthpart morphology of Collembola species and specific carbohydrase activity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The gut contents, amount and several ingredients, have been studied in seven of the commonest soil-living collembola in Southern Sweden. Between 20.6 and 5I.5 per cent of all observed specimens of the different species have no gut contents at all. The possibility that the gut contents are not visible in the lactic acid mounts is discussed. Another possibility is that the gut was emptied in connection with moults. The distribution of the gut contents among the different body segments was studied. With the help of these studies it was possible to obtain an approximate expression for how great a part of all the guts of the population is filled. The percentage of individuals with filled guts varies between 3I.3 and 52.5. It may be concluded from these studies that some species (e.g. Folsomia quadrioculata) eat more sporadically than others (e.g. Isotoma notabilis). It was also concluded that deep-living species more often have filled guts than those that live nearer the surface. This is very probably due to their food being qualitatively inferior to the food of the others. Greater quantities must therefore be treated in the guts of the deeper-living species. This must be of certain significance to the soilbiological importance of the different species. The following ingredients of the gut contents were studied in some detail: (I) Occurrence and quantity of fungal hyphae. (2) Spores. (3) Pollen grains. (4) Exuvia of collembola. (5) Mineral particles. (6) Amorphous mass. Fungal hyphae do not seem to be so common an ingredient of the food of the collembola species which have been examined as the statements of the literature seem to indicate. A considerable proportion of the animals with gut contents, between I2.6 and 7I.I per cent, have no fungal hyphae at all in their guts. It appears as if the amount of fungal hyphae eaten varies with the depth at which the diffefent species tend to live, and inversely with the amount of ingested food. The more superficially the species lives, the less food the individuals eat and the greater the fungal part of the eaten food is. This indicates, in my opinion, that fungal hyphae are the most valuable ingredient of the food of these species. Spores, pollen grains and exuvia are of minor importance. Mineral particles are common ingredients in the gut and this indicates that these species contribute in considerable degree to the transport of minerals in the soil. Amorphous mass, consisting for the most part of unidentifiable material, is almost always a conspicuous ingredient of the gut contents.},

  abstract = {Antarctic soil ecosystems are amongst the most simplified on Earth and include only few soil arthropod species, generally believed to be opportunistic omnivorous feeders. Using stable isotopic analyses, we investigated the food choice of two common and widely distributed Antarctic soil arthropod species using natural abundances of 13C and 15N and an isotope labelling study. In the laboratory we fed the isotomid springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus six potential food sources (one algal species, two lichens and three mosses). Our results showed a clear preference for algae and lichens rather than mosses. These results were corroborated by field data comparing stable isotope signatures from the most dominant cryptogams and soil arthropods (C. antarcticus and the oribatid mite Alaskozetes antarcticus). Thus, for the first time in an Antarctic study, we present clear evidence that these soil arthropods show selectivity in their choice of food and have a preference for algae and lichens above mosses.},

We measured ten morphometric parameters of the chelicerae from 52 species within 29 genera. For 28 species and 26 genera we were able to extract food preferences from the literature and own observations. We found some weak indications that arthropod predators have proportionally larger chelicerae compared to similar-sized species feeding on nematodes or other worm-like diets.

We studied the effects of food quality on body mass and on neutral lipid (NLFA) and phospholipid (PLFA) fatty acid patterns of Collembola. Folsomia candida, Heteromurus nitidus and Protaphorura fimata were fed with common green algae (Chlorella vulgaris), filamentous soil algae (Klebsormidium flaccidum), cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune) and baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Body mass of F. candida and H. nitidus was highest when reared on C. vulgaris and S. cerevisiae. P. fimata gained the most weight when fed baker's yeast. K. flaccidum and N. commune as resources resulted to low biomass in all Collembola. The four diets caused significant differences in the NLFA and PLFA composition of Collembola after six weeks of feeding. Two new trophic biomarker FAs indicating algal diets were assigned with 16:3{$\omega$}3,6,9 and 16:2{$\omega$}6,9, which were only present in NLFAs of Collembola consuming C. vulgaris and K. flaccidum. The amount of FAs from the {$\omega$}7 family was high in Collembola lipids with cyanobacteria and yeast as food sources, whereas only trace amounts occurred in the NLFA fraction with algae as the resource. In summary, common soil algae and cyanobacteria differed in food quality for Collembola, depending on their growth form (unicellular versus filamentous) and/or secondary metabolites (e.g. cyanobacteria). The new FA biomarkers detected will allow further investigation of these trophic interactions under field conditions; for example, assessing the role of collembolan grazers in the formation of biological soil crusts.},

Direct collembolan herbivory influences the establishment of seedlings and the dynamics of plant populations whereas grazing on algae affects their biomass, community composition and dispersal. Studies on feeding behaviour of Collembola have mainly focused on fungi, whereas primary producers as resources have seldom been studied. We assessed the feeding preference of two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Folsomia fimetaria) for food sources from different functional groups using dual choice olfactometers. A preferred fungal species (Alternaria alternata) was compared with two terrestrial microalgae (Chloroidium angusto-ellipsoideum and Pabia signiensis) as well as mucilaginous seeds (Plantago major). A second experiment investigated the choice behaviour of F.~candida between different species of common green algae in soils (Chlorella vulgaris, Stichococcus mirabilis, Stichococcus bacillaris and Coccomyxa sp.). Generally, feeding preferences stabilised over 48~h. F.~candida avoided P.~signiensis compared to the other three food sources whereas F.~fimetaria preferred the seeds of P.~major to the alternative diets. When only soil algae were offered, F.~candida was able to distinguish between different species: S.~mirabilis was clearly preferred to S.~bacillaris and C.~vulgaris. Our results reflect that both Collembola may use a wide range of resources if available and differ in their preference behaviour. Selective feeding on algae or mucilaginous seeds has the potential to modify soil microorganism communities, soil properties and the establishment of seedlings.},

In particular, the detritivores are regarded as food generalists. We have investigated nitrogen stable isotope ratios (15N/14N) of a major decomposer group, the Collembola, to evaluate trophic relationship and determine feeding guilds. Additionally, the {$\delta$}15N values of potential food sources such as mosses, lichens and other plant derived material (bark, nuts, leaves) were analysed. The natural variation in nitrogen isotopes was assessed in 20 Collembola taxa from three deciduous forest stands. The {$\delta$}15N signature formed a continuum from phycophages/herbivores to primary and secondary decomposers, reflecting a gradual shift from more detrital to more microbial diets. The {$\delta$}15N gradient spanned over 9 {$\delta$} units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in 15N of about 3 \textperthousand{} per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three trophic levels. These variations in 15N/14N ratios suggest that trophic niches of Collembola species differ and this likely contributes to Collembola species diversity.},

The change in FA content of the Collembola was observed over the following 39 days. The four diets produced significant shifts in the FA compositions of the Collembola, with P. redivivus causing the most extreme changes; Collembola fed P. redivivus gained complex FA compositions similar to those of the nematode diet. Changes in the relative abundances of some FAs were found to follow negative exponential curves, as the components either accumulated in, or were removed from, the FA pool in the Collembola; abundance half-lives varied between 0.5 and 22.4 days, indicating that Collembolan FA compositions changed readily with the input of new exogenous components. The results demonstrate that Collembolan FA compositions are influenced by diet, and that the abundances of FAs such as i15:0, i17:0 and 18:1(n-7) may be used as biomarkers of nematode consumption by Collembola. In contrast, the C20 polyunsaturated FAs cannot be used as biomarkers for nematode predation as Collembola possess the ability to biosynthesise high abundances of these compounds when not provided by the diet.},

  abstract = {The trophic preferences of soil invertebrates such as Collembola are often determined by the analysis of gut contents, or through visual observations of the location of individuals. As an alternative approach, two species of Collembola, Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta, were offered a choice of the soil fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides or the bacterial feeding nematode Panagrellus redivivus; each exhibited distinct fatty acid profiles and stable carbon isotopic compositions. Over 21 days, the fatty acids i15:0, i17:0, 18:1(n-7) and 18:2(n-6) all increased in abundance in both collembolan species consistent with direct routing from the nematode dietary choice which contained a high concentration of these components. Collembolan fatty acid {$\delta$}13C values increased by between 5.7 and 21.6\textperthousand{} over 21 days reflecting those of the nematode diet. Therefore, both fatty acid profiles and {$\delta$}13C values were consistent with a strong feeding preference of F. candida and P. minuta for the nematodes over the offered fungi. In fact, neither collembolan species consumed any detectable amount of C. cladosporioides. Comparison of the {$\delta$}13C values of the 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids (which are biosynthesised by the Collembola as well as directly incorporated from the diet) and the 16:1(n-7) and 18:2(n-6) components (which are not biosynthesised by the Collembola) demonstrated that the input of distinct pools of C can lead to large shifts in {$\delta$}13C values between diet and consumer. The fatty acids that were not biosynthesised by Collembola better reflected the {$\delta$}13C values of the diet helping to differentiate between biosynthesised and directly incorporated compounds; an important prerequisite in the interpretation of compound-specific {$\delta$}13C values in trophic behaviour tests. The combination of fatty acid distributions and {$\delta$}13C values is a significant improvement on traditional methods of examining feeding preferences, since it determines directly the assimilated dietary carbon rather than relying on indirect observations, such as the proximity of individuals to a defined food source.},

While they are the least abundant of soil mesofauna, mesostigmatan mites play a central role in soils by regulating population dynamics of other meso- and microfauna and by affecting nitrogen mineralization rates. The most abundant and diverse oribatid mites are especially important for decomposition processes in boreal forests. In this study, we evaluated the trophic ecology of mesostigmatan and oribatid mites from Canadian boreal forests by using body {$\delta$}15N signatures as indicators of their trophic position. We extracted mites from the forest floors of control and clearcut stands from coniferous and deciduous stands dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), respectively. The mite values spanned 10.2~{$\delta$} units in 15N, and were enriched by at least 1.2\textperthousand{} compared to forest floor (baseline) values. When compiled to known eating habits from published feeding experiments, isotopic values placed the mites in three main trophic guilds, including detritivorous, omnivorous (overlapping with predators), and predator mites. Isotopic nitrogen fractionation within the mites did not seem to be affected by their habitat (spruce vs. aspen), or clearcutting practices. Instead, in this boreal forest environment, the well-defined degree of isotopic fractionation within the food web may be solely dependent on the mite feeding relationships.},

  abstract = {Studies have been made with some details on the biology and ecology on the mesostigmatid predator mite, Pergamasus crassipes (L.) in the laboratory and in some bavarian forests. The mite was reared in the laboratory to study its life history under three temperature conditions. Temperature had a profound effect on duration of immature stages and oviposition. Food preferences were determined to study its feeding habits and feeding behaviour. A list of accepted and rejected prey species is provided. Distribution of P. crassipes in nine different forest environments in Bavaria was recorded. Seasonal abundance of the predator and its dominant prey, Collembola, was investigated in Siegenburg and Grafrath forests. The outcome of one year's field study revealed the presence of two peaks during July-August and November-December. The population reached a minimum size during February. Zusammenfassung Zur Biologie der Raubmilbe Pergamus crassipes (L.) in der Bodenstreu Bayerischer Waldb\"oden Die r\"auberische Milbe Pergamasus crassipes (L.) (Gammas., Mesostigmatidae) wurde 1971 im Labor und in der Bodenstreu einiger Waldb\"oden Bayerns untersucht. Im Labor wurde die Milbe bei 3 Temperaturstufen gezogen. Entwicklung und Eiablage waren vonder Temperatur stark abh\"angig. Die Ern\"ahrungsweise und das Beutefangverhalten wurden beobachtet. Die angenommenen und abgelehnten Beutetierarten werden aufgez\"ahlt. In 9 Forsten Bayerns wurde die Verbreitung von P. crassipes ermittelt. An 2 Standorten, Siegenburg und Grafrath, wurden die Beziehungen zwischen der Raubmilbe und den Hauptbeutetieren, Collembolen, n\"aher untersucht. Die einj\"ahrigen Studien zeigten zwei Abundanzspitzen: im Juli/August und November/Dezember. Im Februar war die Dichte am geringsten.},

  abstract = {Feeding on a variety of resources, collembolans have been assumed to be food generalists. However, recent stable isotope analyses documented that collembolan species occupy different trophic levels, but detailed studies on species-specific food resources are sparse. Further, it still is little understood whether food resources of collembolan species are constant or shift, e.g., with habitats. Fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope analysis allow insight into utilisation of basal resources and trophic levels of consumers, respectively. We combined these methods to investigate variations in trophic niches of six collembolan species (Lepidocyrtus lanuginosus, Folsomia quadrioculata, Parisotoma notabilis, Ceratophysella denticulata, Isotomiella minor and Protaphorura armata) in beech and spruce forests. We correlated collembolan FAs with that of litter microorganisms at the respective study sites to identify links to resources. FA composition and stable isotope signatures in collembolan species did not differ significantly between forest types but between species suggesting pronounced trophic niche differentiation between species. The trophic niche of C. denticulata and P.~armata was similar and significantly differed from the other species with 13C and 15N signatures being least depleted. We suggest that C.~denticulata has a predatory life style feeding on nematodes. Due to intermediate to low 13C and 15N levels and specific FA compositions the other collembolan species could be ascribed to secondary decomposers with I.~minor being more closely associated with bacterial resources and F.~quadrioculata, L.~lanuginosus and P.~notabilis with fungal resources. However, dietary niches presumably comprise a mixture of resources rather than single resources. FAs in collembolan species correlated poorly with those in litter suggesting that the diet of collembolan species is rather independent of the structure of microbial communities in bulk litter. The results suggest that collembolans consume resources of microsites rather than bulk material thereby benefitting from the small-scale heterogeneity in resource distribution in soil. Low variation in trophic niches with forest type suggests that these microsites are similar across different forests and provide similar food resources despite marked differences in e.g., litter materials and humus structure.},

The study investigates trophic niche diferentiation of Collembola communities from the litter of two Romanian beech forests and determines the origin of posible food sources consumed by springtails using fatty acid technique. {$\delta$}15N signatures of Collembola taxa in the investigated food web spanned over 10{$\delta$} units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in 15N of 3\textperthousand{} per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three to four trophic guilds: phytophages, primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and carnivores. The lipid composition of their potential food resources was assessed in order to gain insight into food web linkages from the forests. Among the 19 fatty acids detected in the PLFA fraction, nine were ascribed as bacterial, one derived from fungi, 2 as plant and 6 occurred in various organism groups, and had ``other'' origin. Most species were either plant litter or fungal feeders, as indicated by high proportions of oleic (18:1w9) or linoleic (18:2w6) acid, but we can say that Collembola feed unselectively on a wide variety of food materials.}

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.},

L. frigida was studied in the laboratory. It feeds on moss leaves, sucking out cell contents but leaving cell-walls intact. The life cycle lasts about 30 days (at 23 {$\pm$} 20 C). Reproduction is arrhenotokous, as isolated females have only male descendants. Females, whether confined with males or isolated, laid about 21 eggs. The mites reproduced freely under both long-day (r6 hours) and short-day (g hours) photoperiodic regimes. Transfer experiments showed that L. frigida will feed and survive on many moss species. Reproduction, however, occurs only whilst feeding on a few of these. Eggs placed in distilled water hatched and the larvae developed to the adult while thus immersed, but no oviposition took place under water. The species L. rhodomela, L. clavata (Canestrini and Fanzago) and L. schustteri Summers and Priee also fed on various mosses and had similar life cycles.},

The present study was undertaken in order to discern main coenological trends along a gradient of metal pollution, downwind of a zinc smelter located in the north of France. Three sites were compared within an abandoned field planted with poplar 20 years ago. The total zinc content of the topsoil varied from 4000 to 35000mg/kg according to distance to the smelter outlet. Changes in humus forms (shift from mull to mor) and in the degree of opening of the poplar stand (mainly caused by death or stunting of planted trees in the vicinity of the smelter) explained most of the observed variation in abundance and species composition. Sun species living at the ground surface appeared at the most polluted sites where poplar declined and was replaced by a sward of metal-tolerant herb species. The increase in abundance of the whole collembolan community was mainly due to Mesaphorura macrochaeta, the gut contents of which indicated that this species avoided the root mat and fed mainly in the mineral soil underneath. Shifts in food habits and/or in habitat were observed in several other common species, pointing to the importance of avoidance behaviour as a mechanism by which collembolan species may endure heavy metal pollution.},

Collembola (springtails) are winter-active arthropods that appear on the snow surface, especially on sunny days, and remain active in microhabitats under the snow. Since winter-active Collembola must be consuming food, we assessed the food resources for these Collembola with stable isotope and bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methods. We collected two Desoria species from the snow surface and Tomocerus cf. jilinensis from subnivean microhabitats. The stable isotope signatures of winter-active Collembola species differed significantly from the soil litter layer. The isotopic signature of Desoria sp.1 was similar to the snow. Furthermore, the putative food resource (bacteria) ingested by Desoria sp.3 and Tomocerus cf. jilinensis were more from snow than from litter. All three Collembola species ingested a large proportion of Cyanobacteria. Moreover, a large proportion of bacteria associated with Collembola were putative symbionts. Bacterial communities and their associated metabolic functions were more similar in the two congeneric Desoria species than with Tomocerus cf. jilinensis. Our findings suggest that winter-active Collembola mainly feed on resources present in the snow layer. Stable isotope and amplicon sequencing methods are promising techniques to evaluate the diets of soil animals that remain active in snow-covered soils.},

In addition, {$\delta$}15N, {$\delta$}13C, C/N ratio, body weight and NLFA/PLFA ratio (neutral lipid/phospholipid fatty acids) of Collembola were assessed. These measures indicated that P. putida ranked first, B. megaterium second and E. aerogenes third in food quality. FAs specific for bacteria were found in the NLFAs of the Collembola reflecting the respective bacterial diet. Biomarker FAs for gram-positive bacteria were methyl branched i14:0, i15:0, a15:0 and i17:0. Consumption of gram-negative bacteria was reflected by the cyclic form cy17:0 (E. aerogenes, P. putida) and by 16:1{$\omega$}5 (P. putida).},

  abstract = {Using bulk tissue and fatty acid 13C analysis we investigated major trophic pathways from soil microorganisms to microbial consumers to predators in conventional versus organic farming systems planted for the first time with maize. Organic farming led to an increase in microbial biomass in particular that of fungi as indicated by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Microbial PLFAs reflected the conversion from C3 to C4 plants by a shift in {$\delta$}13C of 2\textperthousand, whereas the isotopic signal in fatty acids (FAs) of Collembola was much more pronounced. In the euedaphic Protaphorura fimata the {$\delta$}13C values in maize fields exceeded that in C3 (soybean) fields by up to 10\textperthousand, indicating a close relationship between diet and vegetation cover. In the epedaphic Orchesella villosa{$\delta$}13C values shifted by 4\textperthousand, suggesting a wider food spectrum including carbon of former C3 crop residues. Differences in {$\delta$}13C of corresponding FAs in consumers and resources were assessed to assign food web links. P. fimata was suggested as root and fungal feeder in soybean fields, fungal feeder in conventional and leaf consumer in organically managed maize fields. O. villosa likely fed on root and bacteria under soybean, and bacteria and fungi under maize. Comparison of {$\delta$}13C values in FAs of the cursorial spider Pardosaagrestis and O. villosa implied the latter as important prey species in soybean fields. In contrast, the web-building spider Mangora acalypha showed no predator\textendash prey relationship with Collembola. The determination of {$\delta$}13C values in trophic biomarker FAs allowed detailed insight into the structure of the decomposer food web and identified diet-shifts in both consumers at the base of the food web and in top predators in organic versus conventional agricultural systems. The results indicate changes in major trophic links and therefore carbon flux through the food web by conversion of conventional into organic farming systems.},

Using molecular gut content analyses the present study investigates if nematodes indeed form part of the diet of oribatid mites. First, in a no-choice laboratory feeding experiment two nematode species (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita and Steinernema feltiae) were offered to eight species of oribatid mites and one gamasid mite. Second, after feeding for 4 and 48h on each nematode species the detection time of prey DNA in the oribatid mite species Steganacarus magnus was investigated. Third, in a field experiment nematode prey (P.~hermaphrodita and S.~feltiae) in the diet of microarthropods was investigated distinguishing between scavenging and predation. In the no-choice laboratory experiment not only the gamasid mite but also several of the studied oribatid mite species consumed nematodes. After feeding on nematodes for 4h prey DNA was detectable in S.~magnus for only 4h, but after feeding for 48h prey DNA was detectable for 128h, indicating that the duration of feeding on prey is an important determinant for prey DNA detection. The field experiment confirmed that oribatid mite species including Liacarus subterraneus, Platynothrus peltifer and S.~magnus intensively prey on nematodes. Interestingly, DNA of dead P.~hermaphrodita was detectable to a similar degree as that of living individuals indicating that scavenging is of significant importance in decomposer food webs. Results of our study indicate that predation and scavenging on nematodes by ``detritivorous'' microarthropods in soil food webs need to be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Soil animals live in complex and heterogeneous habitats including litter of various types but also microhabitats such as mosses, fungal mats and grass patches. Soil food webs have been separated into a slow fungal and a fast bacterial energy channel. Bacterial-feeding nematodes are an important component of the bacterial energy channel by consuming bacteria and forming prey for higher trophic levels such as soil microarthropods. Investigating the role of nematodes as prey for higher trophic level consumers has been hampered by methodological problems related to their small body size and lack in skeletal structures which can be traced in the gut of consumers. Recent studies using molecular gut content analyses suggest that nematodes form major prey of soil microarthropods including those previously assumed to live as detritivores. Using molecular markers we traced nematode prey in fourteen abundant soil microarthropod taxa of Mesostigmata and Oribatida (both Acari) from three different microhabitats (litter, grass and moss). Consumption of nematodes varied between mite species indicating that trophic niche variation contributes to the high diversity of microarthropods in deciduous forests. Further, consumption of nematodes by Mesostigmata (but not Oribatida) differed between microhabitats indicating that trophic niches vary with habitat characteristics. Overall, the results suggest that free-living bacterial-feeding nematodes form important prey for soil microarthropods including those previously assumed to live as detritivores.},

  abstract = {Nematodes are the most abundant invertebrates in soils and are key prey in soil food webs. Uncovering their contribution to predator nutrition is essential for understanding the structure of soil food webs and the way energy channels through soil systems. Molecular gut content analysis of consumers of nematodes, such as soil microarthropods, using specific DNA markers is a novel approach for studying predator\textendash prey interactions in soil. We designed new specific primer pairs (partial 18S rDNA) for individual soil-living bacterial-feeding nematode taxa (Acrobeloides buetschlii, Panagrellus redivivus, Plectus velox and Plectus minimus). Primer specificity was tested against more than 100 non-target soil organisms. Further, we determined how long nematode DNA can be traced in the gut of predators. Potential predators were identified in laboratory experiments including nine soil mite (Oribatida, Gamasina and Uropodina) and ten springtail species (Collembola). Finally, the approach was tested under field conditions by analyzing five mite and three collembola species for feeding on the three target nematode species. The results proved the three primer sets to specifically amplify DNA of the respective nematode taxa. Detection time of nematode DNA in predators varied with time of prey exposure. Further, consumption of nematodes in the laboratory varied with microarthropod species. Our field study is the first definitive proof that free-living nematodes are important prey for a wide range of soil microarthropods including those commonly regarded as detritivores. Overall, the results highlight the eminent role of nematodes as prey in soil food webs and for channelling bacterial carbon to higher trophic levels.},

The ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria laccata, Pisolithus tinctorius, Suillus luteus, Thelephora terrestris and the pathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani were employed in all experiments. In vitro and in situ experiments revealed that Pr. minuta consumed all the ectomycorrhizal fungi tested but the feeding pattern and consumption varied with each isolate. In a comparative in vitro feeding preference test, where Pr. minuta was given a choice, R. solani was grazed more heavily than the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Among the ectomycorrhizal fungi examined, Pi. tinctorius was consumed significantly less than L. laccata, S. luteus or T. terrestris in the presence of R. solani. A 10-week in situ analysis of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedling root systems inoculated with Pr. minuta revealed that ectomycorrhizal colonization was significantly less than that of control plants (without Pr. minuta).

We investigated preference of the soil predatory mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer Canestrini for the risky pest springtail Protaphorura fimata Gisin relative to the safe non-pest springtail Folsomia candida Willem. Egg production under foraging on live or dead individuals of either prey showed that the two species had equal nutritional quality for G. aculeifer, but indicated that live F. candida were more difficult to catch than live P. fimata. Importantly, some G. aculeifer were killed by P. fimata defence secretions, demonstrating that live P. fimata are risky prey. Preference for P. fimata was generally high when mites were given a choice between a live individual of either prey, but this preference was reduced following exposure to live individuals of P. fimata. Furthermore, fewer G. aculeifer killed a prey and time until kill was longer after experience with live P. fimata. These findings indicate that live P. fimata induced a partial aversion on G. aculeifer during exposure. Our study shows that generalist predators can reduce their preference for risky prey following exposure. This indicates that generalist predators used in biological control against risky prey are most efficient against this prey if not exposed to it prior to release.},

The present study investigates the trophic structure of the Mesostigmata community of old growth beech stands in Central Germany and identifies potential prey groups using natural variations in stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N). Data on relative abundances and body mass were included for each of the 40 species studied to analyze functional aspects in Mesostigmata feeding ecology. The results indicate that Mesostigmata predominantly feed on secondary decomposers, whereas primary decomposer and intra-guild prey are of minor importance. Dominant species featured high {$\delta$}13C signatures suggesting that they predominantly feed on species relying on root derived resources such as bacterial feeding nematodes. Less abundant species where characterized by lower {$\delta$}13C values suggesting that they predominantly feed on prey relying on litter derived resources such as fungal feeding Collembola. Related taxa often had distinctively different isotope ratios suggesting that trophic niche partitioning facilitates coexistence of morphologically similar species. Unexpectedly, the trophic position of Mesostigmata species was not related to body size reflecting the varying trophic position of their main prey, nematodes and Collembola, suggesting that body size is a poor predictor of trophic position in soil food webs.},

Implications of agricultural practice for diversity and population development and consequences for ecological processes are highlighted.

Collembolan grazing of ectomycorrhizae (ECM) can sever connections between the host root and hyphal networks, interrupting nutrient flow and negatively impacting plant growth. Much of the previous information on interactions between Collembola and ECM has been based on mycelium grown in pure culture, which has artificially high nutrient levels and may lack physical and chemical grazing deterrents seen when ECM form on plant roots. We investigated Collembola feeding preferences by offering naturally occurring ECM, identified by ITS sequencing, to Folsomia candida and Protaphorura armata. We also assessed the gut content fungi of Folsomia collected in a mature Pinus strobus stand. We found that some ECM types, including the Tricholoma aestuans, Piloderma bicolor and the tuburculate ECM of Suillus spraguei, were readily grazed, while Cenococcum geophilum and Lactarius vinaceorufescens were unpalatable. Fungi forming unpalatable ECM were readily grazed when not in symbiosis with the host root.},

Among the predators, found in association with R. robini in the field and under storage conditions, mesostigmatic mites predominate. The most abundant species were Hypoaspis aculeifer (Canestrini), Lasioseius bispinosus Evans and Parasitus fimetorum (Berlese). These predators appeared to feed and reproduce on a diet of exclusively R. robini and they were able to control the bulb mite in small-scale population experiments initiated with a 1:20 predator-prey ratio. Under laboratory conditions corresponding to lily bulb propagation (lily scales mixed with vermiculite and stored at 23\textdegree C and {$>$}90\% RH) the laelapid mite, H. aculeifer, was the most effective predator; the ascid predator, L. bispinosus, was much less effective, but being relatively small and being successful in attacking the juvenile stages of the bulb mite it may be better able to search for bulb mites hidden inside the lily bulb. The parasitid predator, P. fimetorum, failed to control the bulb mite when vermiculite was used as a medium, but turned out to suppress this prey when peat was used instead. Various strains of H. aculeifer or closely related species were compared with respect to their impact and performance on bulb mites as prey: two Dutch strains, one obtained from Breezand and the other from 'tZand, a Taiwanese strain, a German strain that in contrast to the previously mentioned strains was not collected from lily bulbs, but from agricultural areas near Bremen and, in addition, a Canadian strain of a related species (Hypoaspis miles Berlese), known to control sciarid fly larvae. These comparative experiments showed that H. miles died out without noticeable impact on the bulb mite population whereas all strains of H. aculeifer were able to suppress the bulb mites to very low numbers. However, the numerical responses of the H. aculeifer strains differed in that those collected in association with the pest (Breezand {$>$} Taiwan {$>$} 'tZand) were superior to the strain from Bremen. These results do not provide support to the Hokkanen and Pimentel hypothesis, which states that predators forming an evolutionary new association with the pest are often more effective in biological control.},

Attack rates were derived and prey selection examined in maritime Antarctic communities at Signy Island. (2) During summer, c. 86\% of the predator population had detectable prey traces. The species composition of these traces in Gamasellus from three major habitat types reflected the proportions of prey observed in the field community, although there were differences between the life-stages of Gamasellus. The collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus (CR) formed c. 80\% of all prey traces. (3) The non-feeding component of the predator population was stable at c. 14\% despite the 10-fold range in Cryptopygus densities between moss-turf, fellfield and ornithogenic sites. (4) Data from field and laboratory experiments showed no detectable functional response over a 300-fold range in prey density. Attack rates upon Cryptopygus calculated by quantitative electrophoresis analysis of field samples confirm this. (5) In laboratory experiments, Gamasellus presented with different size-classes of prey showed maximum attack rates of c. 4 Cryptopygus per predator per day (CR/GA day-1), decreasing with prey size to as little as 0.1 CR/GA day-1 or less for juveniles and c. 0.2 CR/GA day-1 for adults. Mean field attack rates calculated by electrophoresis analysis were more consistent at 0.2 CR/GA day-1 for protonymphs and deutonymphs and 0.4 CR/GA day-1 for adults. These attack rates would easily be sustainable at the lowest field densities of Cryptopygus (c. 1 cm-2) ever likely to be encountered by Gamasellus at Signy Island. (6) Experiments using mixtures of two prey (Cryptopygus and a second collembolan, Parisotoma octooculata) showed that Gamasellus prefers the former species, with feeding being maximal at the ratio of 4 Cryptopygus: 1 Parisotoma. Live weight gain of the predator is also greatest at this ratio. (7) The data validate the method of Lister, Usher \& Block (1987) for the quantification of field attack rates by predatory micro-arthropods. They are discussed in relation to the strategies adopted by an invertebrate predator to maintain its population in extreme habitats containing few prey species.}

Also, six microfungi from similar fungal taxa which were isolated from the F-horizon of Solling (Cladosporium cladosporioides, Mortierella ramanniana, Mortierella parvispora, Mucor hiemalis, Penicillium sp.2 and a sterile dark form) were offered simultaneously and separately to three species of oribatid mites from this site (Cepheus dentatus, Nothrus silvestris and Hypochthonius rufulus). Feeding choice experiments were carried out separately for each oribatid mite species. Generally, oribatid mites from the two different forests preferred similar microfungal taxa as food substrate. The ranking of fungal taxa was very similar in tests where fungi had been offered simultaneously and separately. The oribatid mites studied preferred dark, pigmented fungi (Dematiacea) to hyaline forms. The reason for this preference remains speculative; food quality of dematiaceous fungi might be superior to that of hyaline fungi or oribatid mites may prefer to feed on dematiaceous fungi because they produce more effective exoenzymes ('external rumen'). Despite the general preference for dematiaceous fungi, food selectivity of the oribatid mite species studied differed and the species were ranked in respect to their food specialization: Steganacarus magnus {$>$} Acrogalumna longipluma {$>$} Cepheus dentatus {$>$} Nothrus silvestris {$>$} Hypodamaeus riparius {$>$} Hypochthonius rufulus.

Our aims are (a) to recapitulate the history of stable isotope research in soil animals with a focus on oribatid mites, (b) to present new stable isotope data for oribatid mites and overview the current state of knowledge of oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation, (c) to compile problems and limitations of stable isotope based analyses of trophic relationships and (d) to suggest future challenges, questions and problems that may be solved using stable isotope analyses and other novel techniques for improving our understanding on the trophic ecology of soil invertebrates. We conclude that (1) in addition to 15N/14N ratios, 13C/12C ratios contribute to our understanding of the trophic ecology of oribatid mites, allowing, e.g. separation of lichen- and moss-feeding species, (2) there likely are many lichen but few moss feeding oribatid mite species, (3) oribatid mite species that are endophagous as juveniles are separated by their stable isotope signatures from all other oribatid mite species, (4) fungivorous oribatid mite species cannot be separated further, e.g. the fungal taxa they feed on cannot be delineated. A particular problem in using stable isotope data is the difficulty in determining signatures for basal food resources, since decomposing material, fungi and lichens comprise various components differing in stable isotope signatures; 13C/12C ratios and potentially other isotopes may help in identifying the role of these resources for decomposer animal nutrition.},

  abstract = {Shifting of trophic niches of soil microarthropods may allow them to adapt to changing resource conditions as induced by global change processes. However, the capability of microarthropods to shift their trophic niches is little studied. Whereas some studies based on stable isotopes (15N/13C) point to distinct and narrow trophic niches, others indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we investigated shifts in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a major soil detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e., plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial communities, we expected a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech forest, but more bacterial contributions to the diet in spruce forest. Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA markers indicated that the trophic niches of each of the studied oribatid mite species differed between beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding predominantly on litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on bacteria in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops hirtus, Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been classified as primary or secondary decomposers in previous studies. Overall, the results indicate that the ability of oribatid mite species to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is due to their ability to adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes in trophic niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in environmental conditions and associated changes in resource composition than species above the ground.},

Al-ternaria allernata (Fries) Keissler, Cladosporium cladosporioides(Fresenius) De Vries, Bipolaris tetramera(McKinney) Shoemaker, and Sporotrichum carnis Brooks \&amp; Hansford were the species on which most feeding and reproduction occurred. These species formed a mycelial mat which permitted free movement of the insects and had low spore production. Feeding and reproduction were greater at 15{$\pm$}1\textdegree{} than at 9{$\pm$}1\textdegree C.}

Ceratozetes kananaskis, Ceratozetes gracilis, and Scheloribates spp. were predominant in the fermentation (F) and humus (H) horizons while Eremaeus spp. and Eupterotegaeus rostratus were restricted to the litter (L) horizon. In laboratory studies the five mite taxa were fed and reared upon the seven most common fungal species which had been isolated from the aspen soil. The mite inhabitants of the F and H\textemdash horizons showed variation in amount of feeding and reproductive success among the fungi tested. There was no direct relationship between the amount of mite feeding and reproductive success on any given fungus. The L inhabitants fed very little on fungus in culture and showed no reproduction. Gut content analyses from field specimens showed that all taxa fed on fungi and demonstrated that laboratory feeding studies were a poor indication of feeding type. All taxa fed predominately on the pigmented fungi with the F and H inhabitants showing a higher proportion of hyaline fungi than the L inhabitants; this difference was probably related to the fungal distribution in the soil. Seasonal variation in amount of gut contents was directly related to a postulated level of microbial activity in the soil. Only 2\% of the fungal standing crop would be consumed in 1 yr by the total oribatid mite community emphasizing the importance of assessing the effect of the oribatid mites in conjunction with the other mycophagous members of the soil fauna. Possible interactions between oribatid mites and the fungal community were given and the consequences of the interactions related to organic matter decomposition.},

  abstract = {Mountain scree habitats are intermediate habitats between the base of the soil and the bedrock. They are composed of a network of small cracks and voids, and are commonly situated at the lower levels of scree slopes. Their environment is defined by empty spaces inside the scree, the absence of light and photoperiod, low temperature, and resource poor conditions. Soil arthropod communities, their trophic structure as well as their use of basal resources in mountain scree are little studied despite the fact that they are important components of these systems. Here, we investigate stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari) to understand their trophic niches and their~variation with depth (50 and 75~cm) at two mountain scree sites (Cerdacul Stanciului, Marele Grohotis) in the Romanian Carpathians. Further, we used existing data to investigate the reproductive mode of the species in that habitat, as this may be related to resource availability. We hypothesized that trophic niches of oribatid mites will not differ between the two mountain scree regions but will be affected by depth. We furthermore hypothesized that due to the resource poor conditions oribatid mite species will span a narrow range of trophic levels, and that species are sexual rather than parthenogenetic. Our results showed that (1) oribatid mite trophic structure only slightly differed between the two sites indicating that the trophic ecology of oribatid mites in scree habitats is consistent and predictable, (2) oribatid mite trophic structure did not differ between the two studied soil depths indicating that the structure and availability of resources that were used by oribatid mites in deeper scree habitats varies little with depth, (3) oribatid mite species spanned only three trophic levels indicating that the habitat is rather resource poor, and (4) that all studied oribatid mite species were sexual supporting the view that resource poor conditions favour sexual reproduction.},

In recent years authenticated cases of attacks on man have shown the need for accurate information on feeding habits in this genus. Observations by the writer and others show that species of Balaustium have very generalized feeding habits. Food sources include pollen, leaf tissues, and insects. Man is also attacked, probably in situations which bring numbers of Balaustium into incidental contact with potential human victims. Symptoms of attack vary widely, probably as a result of individual susceptibility, or possibly with the species of Balaustium involved. Information on the latter point is not available at present because of the inadequate state of our knowledge of the systematics of this genus.}

The feeding strategy of two dominant Collembola species, epedaphic Isotoma viridis and euedaphic Willemia anophthalma was determined. The investigation was conducted following a shift to amaranth, a C4 plant, after 27years of continuous C3 crop rotation. The influence of new C4 plant carbon was observed in microbial phospholipids (PLFAs) with higher {$\delta$}13C recorded in C4 amaranth than in C3 clover soils. The strongest enrichment occurred in the fungal PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9c and bacterial PLFA 18:1{$\omega$}9t with 11.2\textperthousand{} and 6.6\textperthousand, respectively. However, other bacterial PLFAs showed no isotopic change, suggesting that the microbial community simultaneously utilized ``new'' and ``old'' plant carbon. The {$\delta$}13C of Collembola fatty acids displayed species specific lipid pattern, which was affected by crop type, but not fertilizer amendments. Isotopic separation of Collembola lipids from amaranth and clover plots was more distinct in I. viridis than W. anophthalma. With up to 18\textperthousand, the enrichment in Collembola lipids was stronger than in microbial PLFAs, pointing to a distinct incorporation of carbon resources originating from the actual plant residues. The {$\delta$}13C pattern in I. viridis indicated trophic links with bacteria, saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues, while saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues were accountable for the patterns observed in W. anophthalma.},

Single adult individuals of six different oribatid mite species (Steganacarus magnus; Nothrus silvestris; Damaeus riparius; Liacarus coracinus; Eupelops plicatus; Achipteria coleoptrata), one collembolan species (Folsomia quadrioculata) and juvenile Pergamasus spp. were offered separately to adult P. septentrionalis in a no-choice feeding experiment. The predators quickly and preferentially fed on collembolans and juvenile Pergamasus; three oribatid mite species were occasionally eaten (L. coracinus, N. silvestris, A. coleoptrata); the other oribatid mite species were rejected as food (E. plicatus, S. magnus, H. riparius). When preying on oribatid mites, P. septentrionalis typically first cut off the legs of the mite, then opened the body through the region of the genital plates or the mouthparts. The results suggest that predator pressure on adult oribatid mites in the field is low, since few relevant predators at the study site are more abundant and powerful than P. septentrionalis. Adult oribatid mites therefore likely indeed live in enemy-free space, i.e. are little affected by predators, but that may not apply to soft-bodied immatures. Collembolans were quickly consumed indicating that they comprise a major part of the diet of P. septentrionalis. Strong feeding on juveniles of Pergamasus suggests that P. septentrionalis also functions as an intra-guild predator.},

Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool for disentangling food web structure. In this study, animals, roots, soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were analysed. The combined measurement of {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes.},

  abstract = {Soil microarthropods are essential for nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems as they are integral components of decomposer food webs. They channel carbon and nutrients from leaf litter and roots to higher trophic levels; however, knowledge on the relative importance of different channels and on their variation with forest type is lacking. Although the importance of root-derived inputs for sustaining soil food webs is increasingly recognized, the pathways by which they are channeled to higher trophic levels are little understood. For the channeling, ectomycorrhizal fungi may play a significant role, but until now methods allowing to separate the contribution of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi to the nutrition of soil animal communities are lacking. Using dual analysis of 15N and 13C in amino acids (AAs), we investigated trophic positions and basal resources of two major groups of soil microarthropods, Collembola and Oribatida, in beech and spruce forests in Germany. By applying a 13C fingerprinting approach and Bayesian mixing models, we separated in a first step the relative contribution of bacteria, fungi, and plants to the nutrition of soil microarthropods. As fungi were identified as the major food source, in a second step we attempted to separate the contribution of ectomycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic fungi. For the first time, we provide direct evidence that soil microarthropods mainly rely on saprotrophic fungi, whereas ectomycorrhizal fungi are consumed by only few species. While trophic niches of Collembola and Oribatida species generally varied little between beech and spruce forests, plant detritus as basal resource of soil microarthropods was somewhat more important in beech forests, whereas in spruce forests microbial resources dominated. Overall, the dual analysis of carbon and nitrogen in AAs provided insight into food web structure of soil microarthropods in unprecedented detail, and for the first time allowed to estimate the relative importance of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for soil food web nutrition, a long-standing riddle in soil food web ecology. The technique provides the perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the trophic structure and energy channeling in soil food webs.},

  abstract = {This paper is the third in a series, the aim of which is to demonstrate the value of micromorphological investigations in soil ecological studies. After microstratification of a soil sample from a Scots pine stand (For\^et d'Orl\'eans, Loiret, France), the F1 layer was studied using the following procedures: 1. Sorting the different components under adissecting microscope, 2. Counting and measuring soil animaIs, observing their digestive tract by clearing or after dissection, and by mounting their faeces, 3. Thin-sectioning different types of vegetation,observing these sections under a light microscope with an appropriate stain procedure. The principal results from this study concern the de composition of pine needles, twigs and bark, ecto-mycorrhizae and their associate mycelia (Cenococcum geophilum and several basidiomycetes), decomposition of mosses (Pseudoscleropodium pururn), bracken leaves and animal bodies in the F1 layer. All the observed needles are comminuted by members of the soil fauna, with different modalities according to their alimentary behaviour. Macrofaunal species (primarily the epigeic lumbricid worm Dendrobaena octaedra) break the needles and ingest entire pieces of vegetation. They make holes which allow both the microfauna (amoebae, nematoda and also some testacea) and mycorrhizal fungi to enter. The same phenomenon can be observed in moss stems and bracken petioles. Lumbricidae are able to crush the pine material and to mix it with other organic elements. Unlike them, woodlice and slugs do not crush the needles, which can be found without any structural change in their faeces,only protoplasm appearing to be digested. Macrofaunal faeces do not seem to promote any bacterial development except at their periphery, unless the excrements are squashed by animal movements, in which case they become more suitable for bacterial contamination. Among the mesofaunal groups, oribatid mites (mainly phthiracarids and euphthiracarids), enchytraeid worms and diptera larvae (sciarids) are very active in tunnelling the needles. Phthiracarid and euphthiracarid mites are specialized feeders on this type of food, while enchytraeids and also, but to a lesser extent, sciarid larvae are more omnivorous. Other oribatid species consume fungal mycelium almost exclusively. Among the Collembola (springtails), the Isotomidae, represented by the three ubiquitous species Parisotoma notabilis, Folsomia manolachei and Isomiella minor, seem to consume only excremental material, while two strongly acidophilic species, Pseudosinella terricola and Willemia anophthalma, consume only fungal hyphae. Cell wall material is probably hydrolyzed, at least partly, by some mesofaunal groups but a distrinction must be made between the three categories: hyaline fungal walls, melanized (dematiaceous) fungal walls, and higher plant cell walls. Hyaline fungal walls seem to be digested by aIl groups except sciarid larvae. Melanized walls are transformed (and perhaps digested to some extent?) only by oribatid mites (mostly camisiid mites), while higher plant cell walls seem to be (at least partly) digested only by sciarid larvae, phthiracarid and euphthiracarid mites, with a distinct browning during passage through the post-colon in the latter two groups. Early wood in the pine twigs is attacked by soft-rot fungi which develop their typical cavitieswithin the S2 layer of tracheid walls. Similar decay pathways were also recorded in pieces of pine bark, moss leaves and bracken petioles.The decomposition of fine roots was also studied and the role of mycorrhizal fungi as prime root invaders at, or prior to root death, is discussed. Generally speaking there seems to be a regression in the development of bacteria (in comparison with the L1 and L2 layers), while mycorrhizal associated mycelia grow not only at the periphery of decaying fragments (as in the L layers), but also through the vegetation tissues.},

Collembolans inhabit different litter and soil layers and their food objects are intimately related to their habitat. Morphological differences that separate high rank taxa of collembolans have clear functional meaning in relation to life style and habitat requirements (including position in the soil profile). However, no study has tested the hypothesis that the species within the major functional groups also differ in terms of trophic positions. This hypothesis was tested for the first time using stable isotope analysis. We compiled original and published data on the stable isotope composition of 82 collembolan species in temperate forest ecosystems. The {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of collembolans were found related to their life forms, reflecting a shift in available food objects across different habitat layers and matching the vertical isotopic gradient of soil organic matter. The trophic niche of species varied among different collembolan orders and families, indicating a pronounced phylogenetic signal and supporting the trophic niche conservatism hypothesis. Considering stable isotope compositions, as well as the taxonomic identity and life form of species, we outlined four collembolan functional guilds that use different types of food and perform different ecosystem functions.},

Implementing conservation and/or classical biocontrol tactics could enhance densities of specialist or generalist predatory mites and lead to pest suppression, but first relevant mite species must be identified and their predatory capabilities evaluated. We conducted lab assays to quantify consumption of immature rootworms and oviposition rates of various mite species. Our study indicates that rootworms are a sub-optimal food source for the mite taxa tested. However, all mite species fed upon rootworms to some degree, although consumption by nematophagous Eviphis ostrinus was extremely low. Predators consumed more rootworm larvae than eggs, and mite size was correlated with prey consumption, with larger predators eating more prey. Four mite taxa (Gaeolaelaps sp., S. miles, Gl. americana, and G. aculeifer) had detrimental effects on survival of rootworm larvae, and the latter two species also had negative impacts on densities of pest eggs. Although it is unlikely that any of these mite species by itself has a major impact on rootworm control, the community of generalist soil-dwelling mites may play an important role in regulating immature rootworm populations in the field.},

Both mites feed upon microbiota and tolerate prolonged submersion in freshwater and their survival among the aquatic moss is a result of their pre-adaptation to similar conditions in flooded soil and vegetation, an absence of predators and minimal competition from other aquatic invertebrates.

Top-down control by micro-arthropod predators may have a significant impact on nematode population dynamics. We report experiments showing that mites and Collembola were capable of reducing nematode numbers in the laboratory and were feeding on a targeted nematode species in the field. A PCR-based approach was developed for the detection of predation on three species of slug- and insect-pathogenic nematodes: Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema feltiae. The collembolan Folsomia candida and the mesostigmatid mite Stratiolaelaps miles were employed as model predators to calibrate post-ingestion prey DNA detection times. Fragments of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA were sequenced and species-specific primers were designed, amplifying 154-, 154- and 203-bp fragments for each of the nematode species. Detection times for nematode DNA within the guts of Collembola were longer than in mites, with half-lives (50\% of samples testing positive) of 08.75 h and 05.03 h, respectively. F. candida significantly reduced numbers of the nematode H. megidis, with rates of predation of {$\sim$}0.4 nematode infective juveniles per collembolan per hour over 10 h. Four taxa of field-caught micro-arthropod that had been exposed to the nematode P. hermaphrodita for a period of 12 h were analysed and significant numbers of three taxa tested positive. This is the first application of PCR techniques for the study of nematophagy and the first time these techniques have been used to measure predation on nematodes in the field.},

We used three already established girdling experiments in northern Sweden, one in a Pinus sylvestris stand and two in Picea abies stands, to determine the effect of tree girdling on soil-living oribatid mites. These mites often feed on fungal hyphae, but it is not known to what extent they feed on EM or saprotrophic fungi. We hypothesised that a presumed decline in EM fungi after girdling would strongly reduce EM-feeding specialists and, correspondingly, reduce total abundance and species richness of oribatids in girdled plots. Tree girdling resulted in a significant decline in total abundance of oribatid mites in the two spruce stands, which was assumed to be linked to the decline in EM fungi, but not in the pine stand. Species richness decreased in girdled plots in one of the spruce forests. The decline in total abundance in girdled spruce stands was primarily dependent on a significant and consistent population decrease in Oppiella nova, which was the most abundant oribatid mite in the ungirdled spruce plots. Its abundance after girdling was only 8\textendash 18\% of that in ungirdled spruce plots. In the pine stand, O. nova had much lower abundance than in the spruce stands, and despite a tendency to decline in number after girdling also in the pine stand, it had a minor effect on total abundance. These results suggest that O. nova may be dependent on EM fungi in spruce forest soils, whereas the dependence on EM fungi in pine forest soils is less evident.},

There are many checklists and catalogues of Collembola for smaller territories and entire continents. Biogeographical analyses have been made for some genera and smaller territories. The most serious problems for a global biogeographical analysis is the lack of enough records from immense territories of all continents. Local biodiversity of Collembola can be very high, reaching over 100 species in small mountain ranges. Sampling methods do not impede documenting biodiversity on a global scale. Collembola have well differentiated ecomorphological life-forms and feeding guilds which enable the functional role that Collembola play in ecosystems to be recognised in some degree. Collembola play an important role in plant litter decomposition processes and in forming soil microstructure. They are hosts of many parasitic Protozoa, Nematoda, Trematoda and pathogenic bacteria and in turn are attacked by different predators. They utilise as food Protozoa, Nematoda, Rotatoria, Enchytraeidae, invertebrate carrion, bacteria, fungi, algae, plant litter, live plant tissues, and some plant pathogens. Soil acidification, nitrogen supply, global climate change and intensive farming have greatly impacted collembolan diversity.},

Furthermore, moulting, growth, survival and reproduction of O. sinensis in the presence of each of the ten test fungi were studied. Mucor plumbeus and Trichothecium roseum were the most preferred whatever the culture substrate and their odour was the most attractive. Two fungi (Penicillium spinulosum and the Basidiomycete S41) attracted Collembola by their odour but were not preferred as food sources.

The natural variation of the stable isotopes 15N/14N was measured in 36 species/taxa from four beech and beech-oak forests. Signatures of {$\delta$}15N formed a gradient spanning over 12 {$\delta$} units suggesting that (a) different species occupy different trophic niches and (b) oribatid mites span three to four trophic levels. This study for the first time documented strong trophic niche differentiation in decomposer microarthropods.

The main aim of this study was to explore the importance of partitioning of food resources for the high diversity of micro-arthropods in soil. In addition, we investigated if ectomycorrhizal fungi are preferentially consumed compared to saprotrophic fungi. Until today, ectomycorrhizal fungi have never been tested as potential food resource for oribatid mites. We offered six ectomycorrhizal fungi [Amanita muscaria (L.) Hook., Boletus badius (Fr.) Fr., Cenococcum geophilum Fr., Laccaria laccata (Scop.) Fr., Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and Piloderma croceum J. Erikss. \& Hjortstam], one ericoid mycorrhizal fungus [Hymenoscyphus ericae (D.J. Read) Korf \& Kernan] and three saprotrophic fungi [Agrocybe gibberosa (Fr.) Fayod, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. and Mortierella ramanniana (A. M\"uller) Linnem.] simultaneously to each of the mainly mycophagous oribatid mite species Carabodes femoralis (Nicolet), Nothrus silvestris Nicolet and Oribatula tibialis Nicolet. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungus H. ericae and the ectomycorrhizal fungus B. badius were preferentially consumed by each oribatid mite species. However, feeding preferences differed significantly between the three species, with O. tibialis being most selective. This study for the first time documented that oribatid mites feed on certain ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {The introduction of white clover in grassland is a common practice to improve the quality of the pasture and to limit the use of industrial sources of inorganic fertilizer N inputs. However, little is known about the extent to which the introduction of different crop compositions affects soil quality in general, and soil biota in particular. Recent studies have shown that epedaphic and euedaphic Collembola can have distinct differences in feeding strategy that suggests trophic niche differentiation according to soil habitat. Combining fatty acid (FA) biomarkers with the carbon isotopic ratios technique, we investigated belowground trophic interactions. We compared the FA composition of the three most predominant groups of Collembola (Isotoma spp., Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Poduromorpha) and bulk soil in white clover-only, a grass-clover mixture, and grass-only plots. Differences between FA-{$\delta$}13C of Collembola groups and the FA-{$\delta$}13C signatures of potential food sources (plant material and soil microorganisms) were calculated to explore trophic links in the three cropping combinations. Collembola showed difference in FA compositions between groups. We observed a lower amount of neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) in Isotoma spp. compared to L.~cyaneus. Poduromorpha showed a higher relative percentage of the NLFAs 16:1{$\omega$}7 and 20:4 compared to L.~cyaneus, and of 18:3 compared to Isotoma spp. The NLFA oleic/linoleic ratio (18:1{$\omega$}9/18:2{$\omega$}6,9) ratio was higher in Poduromorpha compared to L.~cyaneus in all the treatments. Soil FA analysis highlighted a larger fungal/bacterial ratio in grass compared to clover plots, while in Collembola no differences in the FA pattern were detected in relation to the treatments. Nevertheless, results of {$\delta$}13C fractionation in Collembola disclosed differences in the food sources used depending on the crop composition. Apparently, Isotoma spp. and L.~cyaneus fed on clover-related diet in clover plots and more on grass-related diet in mixture treatments while Poduromorpha fed more on a plant-related diet, such as leaf litter, in the mixture treatment. Our results suggest differentiation in Collembola feeding strategy and in the diet in relation to food availability and palatability.},

This ability is particularly important when population densities are high, as in the case of juvenile life stages. The mites N. silvestris and P. peltifer, formerly considered panphytophagic, were shown to have different carbohydrase activities with regard to chitinase, trehalase, and cellulase. N. silvestris is a true panphytophage, but P. peltifer is a macrophytophage rather than a panphytophage. The evaluation of carbohydrase activity as an option in studying the field menu of microarthropods is discussed.},

  abstract = {Decline of soil microarthropod biodiversity is described in the sequence: old forest stands, low-input grasslands, high-input grasslands (with and without the use of persistent pesticides). With this expected trend of declining biodiversity, the patterns of species losses are analysed with the use of classifications of life-history tactics, feeding guilds and tolerances to drought. Species intolerant to drought are absent in grasslands, but present in old forest stands. Also the fraction of thelytokously reproducing microarthropods is higher in old forest stands compared with low-input grasslands. The main difference between low-input and high-input grasslands is found in the feeding guild structure of the community. Low-input grasslands are dominated by (herbo-) fungivorous grazers, whereas high-input grasslands are dominated by fungivorous browsers. Application of DDT in high-input grasslands shows a high density of microarthropods with a high fraction of thelytokous reproduction, associated with a decrease in genetic variation in a thelytokously reproducing species. Patterns in species losses, the species filters, are explained and discussed. It is shown that the decline of biodiversity is not a randorn loss of species but follows and identifiable pattern.},

Direct observations, histology, enzymology and plating techniques were employed to record contact with food, contents and structure of the alimentary tract, presence and viability of bacterial microorganisms inside the mite body, and chitinase and cellulase activity of mite homogenates. Algae were highly palatable, resulting in high apocrine secretion and guts that were continuously full. Initially there was no evidence of chitinase or cellulase production. Chitinase activity started after 10 days, probably due to consumption of fungi that invaded the algal cover, and correlated with the presence of chitinolytic bacteria (Serratia rubidea) in the mite homogenate. Alternaria was grazed intensively, but cell walls of spores and hyphae remained intact and no chitinase was detected suggesting that only cell contents were enzymatically digested. Stachybothrys sp. was rejected as food. The bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis was dominant in homogenates in each of the treatments, but under starvation Achromobacter xylosoxidans became co-dominant. Cellulase activity was not detected in any treatment, but strong chitinase activity was induced with a filter paper (colonized by invasive fungi) diet. Furthermore, bacteria were common in mesenchyme between the internal organs in the filter paper and starvation treatments.},

  abstract = {Two or three microhabitats were defined within each of several habitats within a forest. For example, if `tree' is a habitat, its microhabitats are the moss cover on the tree, the moss at the foot of the tree in contact with the soil, and the soil around the tree. The microhabitat community structure of oribatid mites was recorded. The nutritional biology, especially the type of food and the digestion pattern, of the more dominant species was monitored. Mites were extracted in Berlese-Tullgren funnels, collected in modified Bouin-Dubosque-Brasil fixation fluid, sectioned in paraplast, and stained with Masson triple. Faecal pellets in the rectum were also stained with acridine orange and observed under fluorescent light. Mite microanatomy was evaluated based on nutritional parameters (food bolus, food type, activity of the walls of the intestine, faecal pellets, bacteria within the body, nutritive deposits, metabolites). Some species consume and digest a specific type of food in all microhabitats of one habitat. But others are able to shift diet according to current food supply in a particular microhabitat. A third type of species is ubiquitous and usually consumes a mixture of unspecified food types in every microhabitat studied. Obligate mycophagous oribatids (e.g., Damaeus, Belba or Metabelba) seem to be highly specialized. These genera inhabit mostly soil or microhabitats in contact with soil (e.g., mosses on soil), and are rarely found in moss cover on trees, away from the soil. Other species inhabiting soil microhabitats as well as moss covers on trees (Achipteria coleoptrata, Hermannia gibba) can adapt to the nearly pure fungal food in soil microhabitats, although they graze on a different type of food in a microhabitat consisting of moss covering a tree.},

Previously published data and Layman's metrics were used to compare the structure of the `isotopic trophic niches' and the range of resources used by Oribatida in the tropical forest to those observed in temperate forests. The range of trophic levels occupied by oribatid mites, as reflected in their nitrogen isotopic compositions, did not differ between tropical and temperate forests. In contrast, the range of {$\delta$}13C values of oribatid mites in the tropical community was smaller than that typically observed in temperate forests. This was due to the lack of 13C-enriched species with strongly calcified integuments. The diversity of trophic niches and the range of resources consumed did not differ between temperate and tropical communities of Oribatida. Moreover, similar {$\delta$}15N values were observed for oribatid mite families across temperate and tropical ecosystems, suggesting that the taxonomic system of soil- and litter-dwelling Oribatida is ecologically consistent and supporting the `taxonomic sufficiency' principle.},

  abstract = {Studies on the food selection of Onychiurus fimatus Gisin (Onychiuridae, Collembola), a seedling pest of sugar beet The food selection of Onychiurus fimatus among sugar beet and other food materials was investigated under laboratory conditions. The extent of ingestion of sugar-beet seedlings by O. fimatus was largely determined by the supply of alternative food. From 18 weed-species tested nearly all induced a reduction of the number of Collembola aggregating in the root zone of sugar-beet seedlings. The germinating seeds (radicles visible) of the weeds caused a greater protection of the sugar-beet seedlings than the cotyledon stages. Most weed-species showed less attraction to O. fimatus than sugar beet. An abundant supply of weeds outside of a 15 cm wide, weed-free area surrounding the sugar-beet seedlings caused a strong decrease in the number of Collembola damaging the seedlings. Soil fungi (Phoma, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Alternaria, Apbanomyces) were distinctly preferred to the seedlings by O. fimatus. Antagonistic interactions between O. fimatus and plant-pathogenic soil fungi at seedling-attack were discovered. The damage of sugar-beet seedlings was also influenced by the organic material in the soil, which served as an alternative source of food for the Collembola or as a substrate for the microorganisms. Depending on the amount, type and degree of decomposition of the organic material added (straw, alfalfa, decayed plant material) the attack of O. fimatus to beet seedlings was decreased. Zusammenfassung In Laboruntersuchungen wurde die Nahrungswahl von O. fimatus zwischen Ruben und anderen N\"ahrsubstraten gepr\"uft. Die Intensit\"at des Angriffs von O. fimatus auf R\"ubenkeimlinge wurde weitgehend vom Angebot an Alternativnahrung bestimmt. Von 18 gepr\"uften Unkraut- und Ungrasarten trugen fast alle zu einer Verringerung der Collembolenzahlen an den R\"uben bei. Das Keimlingsstadium f\"uhrte zu einer st\"arkeren Entlastung der R\"uben als das Keimblattstadium. Die meisten Arten besa\ss en allerdings eine geringere Attraktivit\"at f\"ur O. fimatus als die R\"ube. Durch reichliches Angebot von Unkr\"autern au\ss erhalb einer 15 cm breiten, unkrautfreien Fl\"ache um die R\"uben wurde die Zahl der die R\"ube angreifenden Tiere aber stark reduziert. Bodenpilze der Gattungen Phoma, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Altemaria und Aphanomyces wurden von O. fimatus gegen\"uber R\"ubenkeimlingen deutlich bevorzugt aufgenommen. Zwischen O. fimatus und pflanzenpathogenen Bodenpilzen bestanden beim Angriff auf die R\"ube antagonistische Wechselbeziehungen. Die organische Substanz des Bodens \"ubte als Alternativnahrung oder als Substrat f\"ur die Mikroorganismen ebenfalls einen Einflu\ss{} auf die Sch\"adigung der R\"uben aus. Je nach Menge, Art und Zersetzungsgrad der zugef\"uhrten Stoffe (Stroh, Luzerne, Ernter\"uckst\"ande) verringerte sich der Angriff von O. fimatus auf die R\"ubenkeimlinge.},

By 1959 the infestation had spread over 50,000 ha and methods of control were examined. The predatory mite B. lapidaria was known to be an effective biological control agent against S. viridis in Australian pastures. From 1963 to 1966 over 75,000 mites were collected in Western Australia and sent by air for immediate release in selected sites in South Africa (Cape Province). The mites were shown to be established in 1965 and multiplied rapidly, enabling redistribution to additional sites. The influence of this predator on S. viridis numbers is now being monitored. Preliminary data indicate that B. lapidaria is capable of influencing flea densities under South African conditions. A definite relationship between the predator and sminthurid Collembola such as S. viridis slnd Bourletiella arvalis is indicated, although B. lapidaria appears to be able to utilize other foods during periods of sminthurid scarcity.},

  abstract = {Nematodes are an important food resource for many species of soil arthropods. At an intensively studied site in the shortgrass steppe of western Nebraska, at least 33 species of arthropods fed on nematodes. Observations for soil arthopods from other shortgrass steppe sites in Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico, from Chihuahuan desert sites in New Mexico and Texas and from montane litter habitats in Colorado indicate similar patterns of nematophagy. Nematophages include species of parasitiform mites in the families Zerconidae, Ologamasidae, Parasitidae, Laelapidae, Ascidae, Rhodacaridae, Macrochelidae, Eviphididae, Phytoseiidae and Veigaiidae; and acariform mites in the families Alycidae, Alicorhagiidae, Tydeidae, Eupodidae, Paratydeidae, Acaridae, Galumnidae, Haplozetidae and Ceratozetidae. Families of prostigmatid mites traditionally considered predatory are restricted to arthropod prey, and do not feed on nematodes. Some species of Collembola, Coleoptera, Symphyla and possibly small centipedes also feed on nematodes. Nematophagous arthropods fall into 3 trophic classes: (1) omnivores which feed on a variety of algae and fungi as well as on nematodes; (2) general predators of soil invertebrates; (3) nematode specialists. Some omnivores and general predators develop more rapidly and produce more offspring on a diet of nematodes than on other foods. Some mesostigmatid mites are small (allowing access to small pore spaces), have relatively rapid generation times and high reproductive outputs, prefer nematode prey (but can utilize alternative food sources) and are easily cultured. These animals have potential for development as biological-control agents for plant-parasitic nematodes.},

Ecologists have assumed that the function of invertebrates in soil systems can be predicted at a low level of taxonomic resolution, but our research indicates that critical functional parameters -- e.g., feeding behavior, developmental rate, and reproductive mode -- are rarely predictable above the generic level. Since morphology is more strongly conserved than behavior, feeding guilds or functional groups based on broad taxonomic relationship or untested assumptions about correlations between trophic morphology and feeding behavior have little meaning for nematophagous arthropods from grassland soils in Colorado.},

  abstract = {Abstact Forest litter habitats in Australia contain a diversity of early derivative Mesostigmata, including some taxa that cannot be placed in any currently recognised suborder. A new genus, Heatherella, and family, Heatherellidae, are proposed to accommodate two such new species, H. acanthocharis and H. callimaulos, that feed on nematodes and inhabit subtropical rainforest litter in southeast Queensland. Both mites share a number of derived character states otherwise unknown in the Mesostigmata, e.g. the opisthosoma is ringed by nine pairs of spout-like gland openings; the stigmatal opening is contained within a raised, spiky turret; the adults have three setose pygidial shields, and a unique circumventral shield surrounds the intercoxal region. The relationships of the Heatherellidae appear to be closest to the Uropodina; however, the new family lacks major uropodine synapomorphies and shares characters with Epicriina, Microgyniina, and Zerconina (none of which are known to occurin Australia).},

  abstract = {Based on laboratory observations of three species of Allothyrus (Parasitiformes: Holothyrida: Allothyridae) from south east Queensland and gut content analysis of 62 individuals representing 11 species of Allothyrus from eastern Australia, we determined that Australian Allothyridae are scavengers that ingest fluids only. Living arthropods, nematodes, snails and annelids were ignored, but dead arthropods were readily fed upon and were sufficient to maintain adults and nymphs for many months. The adults were sluggish, timid animals that relied on armour, thanatosis and probably on noxious chemicals for protection: the juveniles produced secretions from idiosomal glands. In contrast, most early derivative Mesostigmata that we tested (Sejina, species of Sejus and Uropodella; Uropodina, Polyaspis sp. and Cercomegistina, an undescribed Asternoseiidae) were aggressive predators of small invertebrates and ingested fluids only; however, two species of Asternolaelaps (Sejina) had solid fungal and animal material in their guts. Similarly, the early derivative acariform (Palaeosomata, species of Stomacarus and Loftacarus) and opilioacariform mites (an undescribed Opilioacarida from Australia) that we examined all ingested particulate foods, including fungal and animal material. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the earliest mites were scavengers and opportunistic predators that ingested solid foods and that fluid feeding is a derived condition linking the three orders of Parasitiformes (Holothyrida, Ixodida and Mesostigmata).},
