The duration of the immature stages and of the adult stage were determined. Food type greatly affected female fecundity and feeding capacity. Immature stages of H. vacua consumed in total an average of 13.6 eggs of M. domestica and 33.0 nymphs of R. echinopus, whereas each day throughout her life, the adult female consumed an average of 4.1 eggs of M. domestica and 13.23 nymphs of R. echinopus. Eggs of housefly were the most suitable diet, as it prolonged adult longevity (76.8 days) and increased female fecundity (1.3 eggs/female/day)., L'acarien pr\'edateur, Hypoaspis vacua (Michael) s'est developp\'e avec succ\'es depuis la larve jusqu'au stade adulte quand il s'alimentait sur des oeufs de la mouche domestique Musca domestica (L.) et des larves de l'acarien Rhizoglyphus echinopus (Fum. et Rob.) au laboratoire.

  abstract = {The interrelationships among collembolan feeding groups (FG), decomposition rates, microbial biomass, and forest successional stage were studied at three sites in Douglas-fir dominated stands on the dry leeward side of Vancouver Island, BC, Canada. Each site contained a basic suite (or chronosequence) of four stages of stand development: old-growth ({$>$}248 years), regeneration (7\textendash 9 years), immature (35\textendash 46 years), and mature (80\textendash 102 years). Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify four collembolan feeding groups on the basis of gut contents. Three of the feeding groups (FG 1\textendash 3) were fungal-feeders, but differed from one another in the types of fungal material consumed. The last group (FG 4) comprised species that ingested particulate organic matter (POM). Significant positive correlations between microbial biomass and collembolan abundance were obtained for the fungal-feeding Collembola (FG 1\textendash 3), but not for the detritivorous FG 4. The proportional representation of collembolan species feeding on darkly pigmented fungi (FG 1) was reduced in the regeneration stands, where species feeding on particulate organic matter predominated. Over the 4 years of this study, the mass loss of decomposing wood chips in litterbags was not significantly influenced by the age of the forest in which the bags were placed. In contrast, the mass loss of needle litter was significantly reduced in regeneration stands. Multiple regressions based on the abundance of the different feeding groups of Collembola provided better estimates of the mass loss of decomposing litter or wood chips than did regressions based on total collembolan numbers.},

(3) The soil animal populations were qualitatively and quantitatively similar in the two series of litter bags despite marked differences in the decomposition rates of the two leaf species. Evidence suggested that the soil animal populations in the bags were governed by non-nutritional properties of the litter. (4) Succession of Crytostigmata (Acari) in the leaf litter was demonstrated but the 12 most abundant species were present in the bags throughout the study and showed marked changes in their feeding habits with time.

Springtails (Collembola) that feed on fungal spores and mycelia may contribute to dispersal through carrying fungal propagules in their guts or on their appendages. The Collembola\textendash fungal associations are mainly investigated by microscopy or culturing techniques, which allow identify only fungi that have distinctive morphological characteristics or that can be cultured in~vitro. Here we identified the Collembola-associated fungi on the body surface and in the gut content using both culturing and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods. We studied three epigeic Collembola species found on the Norway spruce dominated forest stands throughout the vegetation period \textendash{} Entomobrya nivalis, Orchesella flavescens and Pogonognathellus longicornis. We discovered over 1200 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs), i.e. the proxies for species, based on 97\% sequence similarity of the ITS2 subregion of ribosomal DNA. Most of the fungi were saprotrophs, but we detected also mycorrhizal, parasitic and lichenized fungi. Season was the most important factor affecting fungal richness and composition, especially on body surface. Although the data matrix revealed significant effect of substrate, we were unable to detect the significant fungal community differences between body surface and gut samples of conspecifics. There were no significant differences among studied epigeic Collembola species in the preference for fungal diet. Our study demonstrates that collembolans associate with a broader range of fungi than previously observed and thus potentially play an important role in enhancing fungal colonization through dispersal activities.},

It reports on the feeding habit of 69 species-level taxa (39 newly observed; 30 from the literature) belonging to 36 genera and 16 families of Mesostigmata. Feeding observations were made in small laboratory arenas where mites were offered sympatric arthropods or cultured rhabditid nematodes, springtails and mites. Most species tested readily fed on nematodes and springtails and many attacked the nymphs of mesostigmatic mites. A few fed on the fluids of crushed or decomposing arthropods. As indicated by studies on other continents, our results support the hypothesis that many soil Mesostigmata, including both ground and canopy species, are generalist predators that feed on nematodes and a variety of arthropod prey. These findings also suggest that some Mesostigmata are opportunistic scavengers.},

The activity of three carbohydrases was measured, i.e. trehalase, cellulase and chitinase. Species were classified in feeding guilds based on the presence or absence of enzymatic activity. The majority of the samples analysed showed trehalase and cellulase activity, and indicate that Collembola commonly have the ability to digest cell walls of plants and algae, and the contents of fungal hyphae. Most of the species examined had chitinase activity, and are able to digest fungal cell walls. Based on the results, four feeding guilds were distinguished, i.e. herbo-fungivorous grazers (nine species), fungivorous grazers (two species), opportunistic herbofungivores (one species) and omnivore (one species). Five species could not be classified due to low number of samples. One more feeding guild was indicated if the levels of enzymatic activity within species were taken into account, i.e. fungivorous browsers. The results show that most species have the ability to digest the food items reported from gut content analyses. Between species, significant difference in specific enzymatic activity was recorded. These findings suggest that, together with information on feeding guilds, under field conditions the various species in the community differed in their food choice. It is hypothesised that a relationship exists between the mouthpart morphology of Collembola species and specific carbohydrase activity.},

  abstract = {Abstract The gut contents, amount and several ingredients, have been studied in seven of the commonest soil-living collembola in Southern Sweden. Between 20.6 and 5I.5 per cent of all observed specimens of the different species have no gut contents at all. The possibility that the gut contents are not visible in the lactic acid mounts is discussed. Another possibility is that the gut was emptied in connection with moults. The distribution of the gut contents among the different body segments was studied. With the help of these studies it was possible to obtain an approximate expression for how great a part of all the guts of the population is filled. The percentage of individuals with filled guts varies between 3I.3 and 52.5. It may be concluded from these studies that some species (e.g. Folsomia quadrioculata) eat more sporadically than others (e.g. Isotoma notabilis). It was also concluded that deep-living species more often have filled guts than those that live nearer the surface. This is very probably due to their food being qualitatively inferior to the food of the others. Greater quantities must therefore be treated in the guts of the deeper-living species. This must be of certain significance to the soilbiological importance of the different species. The following ingredients of the gut contents were studied in some detail: (I) Occurrence and quantity of fungal hyphae. (2) Spores. (3) Pollen grains. (4) Exuvia of collembola. (5) Mineral particles. (6) Amorphous mass. Fungal hyphae do not seem to be so common an ingredient of the food of the collembola species which have been examined as the statements of the literature seem to indicate. A considerable proportion of the animals with gut contents, between I2.6 and 7I.I per cent, have no fungal hyphae at all in their guts. It appears as if the amount of fungal hyphae eaten varies with the depth at which the diffefent species tend to live, and inversely with the amount of ingested food. The more superficially the species lives, the less food the individuals eat and the greater the fungal part of the eaten food is. This indicates, in my opinion, that fungal hyphae are the most valuable ingredient of the food of these species. Spores, pollen grains and exuvia are of minor importance. Mineral particles are common ingredients in the gut and this indicates that these species contribute in considerable degree to the transport of minerals in the soil. Amorphous mass, consisting for the most part of unidentifiable material, is almost always a conspicuous ingredient of the gut contents.},

  abstract = {Antarctic soil ecosystems are amongst the most simplified on Earth and include only few soil arthropod species, generally believed to be opportunistic omnivorous feeders. Using stable isotopic analyses, we investigated the food choice of two common and widely distributed Antarctic soil arthropod species using natural abundances of 13C and 15N and an isotope labelling study. In the laboratory we fed the isotomid springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus six potential food sources (one algal species, two lichens and three mosses). Our results showed a clear preference for algae and lichens rather than mosses. These results were corroborated by field data comparing stable isotope signatures from the most dominant cryptogams and soil arthropods (C. antarcticus and the oribatid mite Alaskozetes antarcticus). Thus, for the first time in an Antarctic study, we present clear evidence that these soil arthropods show selectivity in their choice of food and have a preference for algae and lichens above mosses.},

We measured ten morphometric parameters of the chelicerae from 52 species within 29 genera. For 28 species and 26 genera we were able to extract food preferences from the literature and own observations. We found some weak indications that arthropod predators have proportionally larger chelicerae compared to similar-sized species feeding on nematodes or other worm-like diets.

We studied the effects of food quality on body mass and on neutral lipid (NLFA) and phospholipid (PLFA) fatty acid patterns of Collembola. Folsomia candida, Heteromurus nitidus and Protaphorura fimata were fed with common green algae (Chlorella vulgaris), filamentous soil algae (Klebsormidium flaccidum), cyanobacteria (Nostoc commune) and baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Body mass of F. candida and H. nitidus was highest when reared on C. vulgaris and S. cerevisiae. P. fimata gained the most weight when fed baker's yeast. K. flaccidum and N. commune as resources resulted to low biomass in all Collembola. The four diets caused significant differences in the NLFA and PLFA composition of Collembola after six weeks of feeding. Two new trophic biomarker FAs indicating algal diets were assigned with 16:3{$\omega$}3,6,9 and 16:2{$\omega$}6,9, which were only present in NLFAs of Collembola consuming C. vulgaris and K. flaccidum. The amount of FAs from the {$\omega$}7 family was high in Collembola lipids with cyanobacteria and yeast as food sources, whereas only trace amounts occurred in the NLFA fraction with algae as the resource. In summary, common soil algae and cyanobacteria differed in food quality for Collembola, depending on their growth form (unicellular versus filamentous) and/or secondary metabolites (e.g. cyanobacteria). The new FA biomarkers detected will allow further investigation of these trophic interactions under field conditions; for example, assessing the role of collembolan grazers in the formation of biological soil crusts.},

Direct collembolan herbivory influences the establishment of seedlings and the dynamics of plant populations whereas grazing on algae affects their biomass, community composition and dispersal. Studies on feeding behaviour of Collembola have mainly focused on fungi, whereas primary producers as resources have seldom been studied. We assessed the feeding preference of two Collembola species (Folsomia candida and Folsomia fimetaria) for food sources from different functional groups using dual choice olfactometers. A preferred fungal species (Alternaria alternata) was compared with two terrestrial microalgae (Chloroidium angusto-ellipsoideum and Pabia signiensis) as well as mucilaginous seeds (Plantago major). A second experiment investigated the choice behaviour of F.~candida between different species of common green algae in soils (Chlorella vulgaris, Stichococcus mirabilis, Stichococcus bacillaris and Coccomyxa sp.). Generally, feeding preferences stabilised over 48~h. F.~candida avoided P.~signiensis compared to the other three food sources whereas F.~fimetaria preferred the seeds of P.~major to the alternative diets. When only soil algae were offered, F.~candida was able to distinguish between different species: S.~mirabilis was clearly preferred to S.~bacillaris and C.~vulgaris. Our results reflect that both Collembola may use a wide range of resources if available and differ in their preference behaviour. Selective feeding on algae or mucilaginous seeds has the potential to modify soil microorganism communities, soil properties and the establishment of seedlings.},

In particular, the detritivores are regarded as food generalists. We have investigated nitrogen stable isotope ratios (15N/14N) of a major decomposer group, the Collembola, to evaluate trophic relationship and determine feeding guilds. Additionally, the {$\delta$}15N values of potential food sources such as mosses, lichens and other plant derived material (bark, nuts, leaves) were analysed. The natural variation in nitrogen isotopes was assessed in 20 Collembola taxa from three deciduous forest stands. The {$\delta$}15N signature formed a continuum from phycophages/herbivores to primary and secondary decomposers, reflecting a gradual shift from more detrital to more microbial diets. The {$\delta$}15N gradient spanned over 9 {$\delta$} units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in 15N of about 3 \textperthousand{} per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three trophic levels. These variations in 15N/14N ratios suggest that trophic niches of Collembola species differ and this likely contributes to Collembola species diversity.},

The change in FA content of the Collembola was observed over the following 39 days. The four diets produced significant shifts in the FA compositions of the Collembola, with P. redivivus causing the most extreme changes; Collembola fed P. redivivus gained complex FA compositions similar to those of the nematode diet. Changes in the relative abundances of some FAs were found to follow negative exponential curves, as the components either accumulated in, or were removed from, the FA pool in the Collembola; abundance half-lives varied between 0.5 and 22.4 days, indicating that Collembolan FA compositions changed readily with the input of new exogenous components. The results demonstrate that Collembolan FA compositions are influenced by diet, and that the abundances of FAs such as i15:0, i17:0 and 18:1(n-7) may be used as biomarkers of nematode consumption by Collembola. In contrast, the C20 polyunsaturated FAs cannot be used as biomarkers for nematode predation as Collembola possess the ability to biosynthesise high abundances of these compounds when not provided by the diet.},

  abstract = {The trophic preferences of soil invertebrates such as Collembola are often determined by the analysis of gut contents, or through visual observations of the location of individuals. As an alternative approach, two species of Collembola, Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta, were offered a choice of the soil fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides or the bacterial feeding nematode Panagrellus redivivus; each exhibited distinct fatty acid profiles and stable carbon isotopic compositions. Over 21 days, the fatty acids i15:0, i17:0, 18:1(n-7) and 18:2(n-6) all increased in abundance in both collembolan species consistent with direct routing from the nematode dietary choice which contained a high concentration of these components. Collembolan fatty acid {$\delta$}13C values increased by between 5.7 and 21.6\textperthousand{} over 21 days reflecting those of the nematode diet. Therefore, both fatty acid profiles and {$\delta$}13C values were consistent with a strong feeding preference of F. candida and P. minuta for the nematodes over the offered fungi. In fact, neither collembolan species consumed any detectable amount of C. cladosporioides. Comparison of the {$\delta$}13C values of the 16:0 and 18:0 fatty acids (which are biosynthesised by the Collembola as well as directly incorporated from the diet) and the 16:1(n-7) and 18:2(n-6) components (which are not biosynthesised by the Collembola) demonstrated that the input of distinct pools of C can lead to large shifts in {$\delta$}13C values between diet and consumer. The fatty acids that were not biosynthesised by Collembola better reflected the {$\delta$}13C values of the diet helping to differentiate between biosynthesised and directly incorporated compounds; an important prerequisite in the interpretation of compound-specific {$\delta$}13C values in trophic behaviour tests. The combination of fatty acid distributions and {$\delta$}13C values is a significant improvement on traditional methods of examining feeding preferences, since it determines directly the assimilated dietary carbon rather than relying on indirect observations, such as the proximity of individuals to a defined food source.},

While they are the least abundant of soil mesofauna, mesostigmatan mites play a central role in soils by regulating population dynamics of other meso- and microfauna and by affecting nitrogen mineralization rates. The most abundant and diverse oribatid mites are especially important for decomposition processes in boreal forests. In this study, we evaluated the trophic ecology of mesostigmatan and oribatid mites from Canadian boreal forests by using body {$\delta$}15N signatures as indicators of their trophic position. We extracted mites from the forest floors of control and clearcut stands from coniferous and deciduous stands dominated by white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), respectively. The mite values spanned 10.2~{$\delta$} units in 15N, and were enriched by at least 1.2\textperthousand{} compared to forest floor (baseline) values. When compiled to known eating habits from published feeding experiments, isotopic values placed the mites in three main trophic guilds, including detritivorous, omnivorous (overlapping with predators), and predator mites. Isotopic nitrogen fractionation within the mites did not seem to be affected by their habitat (spruce vs. aspen), or clearcutting practices. Instead, in this boreal forest environment, the well-defined degree of isotopic fractionation within the food web may be solely dependent on the mite feeding relationships.},

  abstract = {Feeding on a variety of resources, collembolans have been assumed to be food generalists. However, recent stable isotope analyses documented that collembolan species occupy different trophic levels, but detailed studies on species-specific food resources are sparse. Further, it still is little understood whether food resources of collembolan species are constant or shift, e.g., with habitats. Fatty acid (FA) and stable isotope analysis allow insight into utilisation of basal resources and trophic levels of consumers, respectively. We combined these methods to investigate variations in trophic niches of six collembolan species (Lepidocyrtus lanuginosus, Folsomia quadrioculata, Parisotoma notabilis, Ceratophysella denticulata, Isotomiella minor and Protaphorura armata) in beech and spruce forests. We correlated collembolan FAs with that of litter microorganisms at the respective study sites to identify links to resources. FA composition and stable isotope signatures in collembolan species did not differ significantly between forest types but between species suggesting pronounced trophic niche differentiation between species. The trophic niche of C. denticulata and P.~armata was similar and significantly differed from the other species with 13C and 15N signatures being least depleted. We suggest that C.~denticulata has a predatory life style feeding on nematodes. Due to intermediate to low 13C and 15N levels and specific FA compositions the other collembolan species could be ascribed to secondary decomposers with I.~minor being more closely associated with bacterial resources and F.~quadrioculata, L.~lanuginosus and P.~notabilis with fungal resources. However, dietary niches presumably comprise a mixture of resources rather than single resources. FAs in collembolan species correlated poorly with those in litter suggesting that the diet of collembolan species is rather independent of the structure of microbial communities in bulk litter. The results suggest that collembolans consume resources of microsites rather than bulk material thereby benefitting from the small-scale heterogeneity in resource distribution in soil. Low variation in trophic niches with forest type suggests that these microsites are similar across different forests and provide similar food resources despite marked differences in e.g., litter materials and humus structure.},

The study investigates trophic niche diferentiation of Collembola communities from the litter of two Romanian beech forests and determines the origin of posible food sources consumed by springtails using fatty acid technique. {$\delta$}15N signatures of Collembola taxa in the investigated food web spanned over 10{$\delta$} units, which implies a wide range in food sources used. Assuming a shift in 15N of 3\textperthousand{} per trophic level, the results indicate a range of three to four trophic guilds: phytophages, primary decomposers, secondary decomposers and carnivores. The lipid composition of their potential food resources was assessed in order to gain insight into food web linkages from the forests. Among the 19 fatty acids detected in the PLFA fraction, nine were ascribed as bacterial, one derived from fungi, 2 as plant and 6 occurred in various organism groups, and had ``other'' origin. Most species were either plant litter or fungal feeders, as indicated by high proportions of oleic (18:1w9) or linoleic (18:2w6) acid, but we can say that Collembola feed unselectively on a wide variety of food materials.}

We hypothesized that community structure and trophic position of oribatid mites of dry grassland soils and bark of trees are similar since these habitats have similar abiotic characteristics (open, dry) compared with forest soil. Further, we hypothesized that derived taxa of oribatid mites reproducing sexually dominate on the bark of trees since species in this habitat consume living resources such as lichens. In contrast to our hypothesis, the community structure of oribatid mites differed among grassland, forest and bark indicating the existence of niche differentiation in the respective oribatid mite species. In agreement with our hypothesis, sexually reproducing taxa of oribatid mites dominated on the bark of trees whereas parthenogenetic species were more frequent in soil. Several species of bark-living oribatid mites had stable isotope signatures that were similar to lichens indicating that they feed on lichens. However, nine species that frequently occurred on tree bark did not feed on lichens according to their stable isotope signatures. No oribatid mite species could be ascribed to moss feeding. We conclude that sexual reproduction served as preadaptation for oribatid mites allowing them to exploit new habitats and new resources on the bark of trees. Abiotic factors likely are of limited importance for bark-living oribatid mites since harsh abiotic conditions are assumed to favor parthenogenesis.},

L. frigida was studied in the laboratory. It feeds on moss leaves, sucking out cell contents but leaving cell-walls intact. The life cycle lasts about 30 days (at 23 {$\pm$} 20 C). Reproduction is arrhenotokous, as isolated females have only male descendants. Females, whether confined with males or isolated, laid about 21 eggs. The mites reproduced freely under both long-day (r6 hours) and short-day (g hours) photoperiodic regimes. Transfer experiments showed that L. frigida will feed and survive on many moss species. Reproduction, however, occurs only whilst feeding on a few of these. Eggs placed in distilled water hatched and the larvae developed to the adult while thus immersed, but no oviposition took place under water. The species L. rhodomela, L. clavata (Canestrini and Fanzago) and L. schustteri Summers and Priee also fed on various mosses and had similar life cycles.},

The present study was undertaken in order to discern main coenological trends along a gradient of metal pollution, downwind of a zinc smelter located in the north of France. Three sites were compared within an abandoned field planted with poplar 20 years ago. The total zinc content of the topsoil varied from 4000 to 35000mg/kg according to distance to the smelter outlet. Changes in humus forms (shift from mull to mor) and in the degree of opening of the poplar stand (mainly caused by death or stunting of planted trees in the vicinity of the smelter) explained most of the observed variation in abundance and species composition. Sun species living at the ground surface appeared at the most polluted sites where poplar declined and was replaced by a sward of metal-tolerant herb species. The increase in abundance of the whole collembolan community was mainly due to Mesaphorura macrochaeta, the gut contents of which indicated that this species avoided the root mat and fed mainly in the mineral soil underneath. Shifts in food habits and/or in habitat were observed in several other common species, pointing to the importance of avoidance behaviour as a mechanism by which collembolan species may endure heavy metal pollution.},

Collembola (springtails) are winter-active arthropods that appear on the snow surface, especially on sunny days, and remain active in microhabitats under the snow. Since winter-active Collembola must be consuming food, we assessed the food resources for these Collembola with stable isotope and bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methods. We collected two Desoria species from the snow surface and Tomocerus cf. jilinensis from subnivean microhabitats. The stable isotope signatures of winter-active Collembola species differed significantly from the soil litter layer. The isotopic signature of Desoria sp.1 was similar to the snow. Furthermore, the putative food resource (bacteria) ingested by Desoria sp.3 and Tomocerus cf. jilinensis were more from snow than from litter. All three Collembola species ingested a large proportion of Cyanobacteria. Moreover, a large proportion of bacteria associated with Collembola were putative symbionts. Bacterial communities and their associated metabolic functions were more similar in the two congeneric Desoria species than with Tomocerus cf. jilinensis. Our findings suggest that winter-active Collembola mainly feed on resources present in the snow layer. Stable isotope and amplicon sequencing methods are promising techniques to evaluate the diets of soil animals that remain active in snow-covered soils.},

FAs specific for bacteria were found in the NLFAs of the Collembola reflecting the respective bacterial diet. Biomarker FAs for gram-positive bacteria were methyl branched i14:0, i15:0, a15:0 and i17:0.

Organic farming led to an increase in microbial biomass in particular that of fungi as indicated by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). Microbial PLFAs reflected the conversion from C3 to C4 plants by a shift in {$\delta$}13C of 2\textperthousand, whereas the isotopic signal in fatty acids (FAs) of Collembola was much more pronounced. In the euedaphic Protaphorura fimata the {$\delta$}13C values in maize fields exceeded that in C3 (soybean) fields by up to 10\textperthousand, indicating a close relationship between diet and vegetation cover. In the epedaphic Orchesella villosa{$\delta$}13C values shifted by 4\textperthousand, suggesting a wider food spectrum including carbon of former C3 crop residues. Differences in {$\delta$}13C of corresponding FAs in consumers and resources were assessed to assign food web links. P. fimata was suggested as root and fungal feeder in soybean fields, fungal feeder in conventional and leaf consumer in organically managed maize fields. O. villosa likely fed on root and bacteria under soybean, and bacteria and fungi under maize. Comparison of {$\delta$}13C values in FAs of the cursorial spider Pardosaagrestis and O. villosa implied the latter as important prey species in soybean fields. In contrast, the web-building spider Mangora acalypha showed no predator\textendash prey relationship with Collembola. The determination of {$\delta$}13C values in trophic biomarker FAs allowed detailed insight into the structure of the decomposer food web and identified diet-shifts in both consumers at the base of the food web and in top predators in organic versus conventional agricultural systems. The results indicate changes in major trophic links and therefore carbon flux through the food web by conversion of conventional into organic farming systems.},

Using molecular gut content analyses the present study investigates if nematodes indeed form part of the diet of oribatid mites. First, in a no-choice laboratory feeding experiment two nematode species (Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita and Steinernema feltiae) were offered to eight species of oribatid mites and one gamasid mite. Second, after feeding for 4 and 48h on each nematode species the detection time of prey DNA in the oribatid mite species Steganacarus magnus was investigated. Third, in a field experiment nematode prey (P.~hermaphrodita and S.~feltiae) in the diet of microarthropods was investigated distinguishing between scavenging and predation. In the no-choice laboratory experiment not only the gamasid mite but also several of the studied oribatid mite species consumed nematodes. After feeding on nematodes for 4h prey DNA was detectable in S.~magnus for only 4h, but after feeding for 48h prey DNA was detectable for 128h, indicating that the duration of feeding on prey is an important determinant for prey DNA detection. The field experiment confirmed that oribatid mite species including Liacarus subterraneus, Platynothrus peltifer and S.~magnus intensively prey on nematodes. Interestingly, DNA of dead P.~hermaphrodita was detectable to a similar degree as that of living individuals indicating that scavenging is of significant importance in decomposer food webs. Results of our study indicate that predation and scavenging on nematodes by ``detritivorous'' microarthropods in soil food webs need to be reconsidered.},

  abstract = {Soil animals live in complex and heterogeneous habitats including litter of various types but also microhabitats such as mosses, fungal mats and grass patches. Soil food webs have been separated into a slow fungal and a fast bacterial energy channel. Bacterial-feeding nematodes are an important component of the bacterial energy channel by consuming bacteria and forming prey for higher trophic levels such as soil microarthropods. Investigating the role of nematodes as prey for higher trophic level consumers has been hampered by methodological problems related to their small body size and lack in skeletal structures which can be traced in the gut of consumers. Recent studies using molecular gut content analyses suggest that nematodes form major prey of soil microarthropods including those previously assumed to live as detritivores. Using molecular markers we traced nematode prey in fourteen abundant soil microarthropod taxa of Mesostigmata and Oribatida (both Acari) from three different microhabitats (litter, grass and moss). Consumption of nematodes varied between mite species indicating that trophic niche variation contributes to the high diversity of microarthropods in deciduous forests. Further, consumption of nematodes by Mesostigmata (but not Oribatida) differed between microhabitats indicating that trophic niches vary with habitat characteristics. Overall, the results suggest that free-living bacterial-feeding nematodes form important prey for soil microarthropods including those previously assumed to live as detritivores.},

  abstract = {Nematodes are the most abundant invertebrates in soils and are key prey in soil food webs. Uncovering their contribution to predator nutrition is essential for understanding the structure of soil food webs and the way energy channels through soil systems. Molecular gut content analysis of consumers of nematodes, such as soil microarthropods, using specific DNA markers is a novel approach for studying predator\textendash prey interactions in soil. We designed new specific primer pairs (partial 18S rDNA) for individual soil-living bacterial-feeding nematode taxa (Acrobeloides buetschlii, Panagrellus redivivus, Plectus velox and Plectus minimus). Primer specificity was tested against more than 100 non-target soil organisms. Further, we determined how long nematode DNA can be traced in the gut of predators. Potential predators were identified in laboratory experiments including nine soil mite (Oribatida, Gamasina and Uropodina) and ten springtail species (Collembola). Finally, the approach was tested under field conditions by analyzing five mite and three collembola species for feeding on the three target nematode species. The results proved the three primer sets to specifically amplify DNA of the respective nematode taxa. Detection time of nematode DNA in predators varied with time of prey exposure. Further, consumption of nematodes in the laboratory varied with microarthropod species. Our field study is the first definitive proof that free-living nematodes are important prey for a wide range of soil microarthropods including those commonly regarded as detritivores. Overall, the results highlight the eminent role of nematodes as prey in soil food webs and for channelling bacterial carbon to higher trophic levels.},

The ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria laccata, Pisolithus tinctorius, Suillus luteus, Thelephora terrestris and the pathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani were employed in all experiments. In vitro and in situ experiments revealed that Pr. minuta consumed all the ectomycorrhizal fungi tested but the feeding pattern and consumption varied with each isolate. In a comparative in vitro feeding preference test, where Pr. minuta was given a choice, R. solani was grazed more heavily than the ectomycorrhizal fungi. Among the ectomycorrhizal fungi examined, Pi. tinctorius was consumed significantly less than L. laccata, S. luteus or T. terrestris in the presence of R. solani. A 10-week in situ analysis of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) seedling root systems inoculated with Pr. minuta revealed that ectomycorrhizal colonization was significantly less than that of control plants (without Pr. minuta).

  abstract = {Generalist predators potentially have access to a wide array of prey, but it is little studied how experience with specific prey affects preference for this prey. In particular, it is unknown how experience with pest prey affects predator foraging decisions in cases where the pest is nutritious but protected by a repelling, potentially deadly defence. We investigated preference of the soil predatory mite Gaeolaelaps aculeifer Canestrini for the risky pest springtail Protaphorura fimata Gisin relative to the safe non-pest springtail Folsomia candida Willem. Egg production under foraging on live or dead individuals of either prey showed that the two species had equal nutritional quality for G. aculeifer, but indicated that live F. candida were more difficult to catch than live P. fimata. Importantly, some G. aculeifer were killed by P. fimata defence secretions, demonstrating that live P. fimata are risky prey. Preference for P. fimata was generally high when mites were given a choice between a live individual of either prey, but this preference was reduced following exposure to live individuals of P. fimata. Furthermore, fewer G. aculeifer killed a prey and time until kill was longer after experience with live P. fimata. These findings indicate that live P. fimata induced a partial aversion on G. aculeifer during exposure. Our study shows that generalist predators can reduce their preference for risky prey following exposure. This indicates that generalist predators used in biological control against risky prey are most efficient against this prey if not exposed to it prior to release.},

The present study investigates the trophic structure of the Mesostigmata community of old growth beech stands in Central Germany and identifies potential prey groups using natural variations in stable isotope ratios (13C/12C and 15N/14N). Data on relative abundances and body mass were included for each of the 40 species studied to analyze functional aspects in Mesostigmata feeding ecology. The results indicate that Mesostigmata predominantly feed on secondary decomposers, whereas primary decomposer and intra-guild prey are of minor importance. Dominant species featured high {$\delta$}13C signatures suggesting that they predominantly feed on species relying on root derived resources such as bacterial feeding nematodes. Less abundant species where characterized by lower {$\delta$}13C values suggesting that they predominantly feed on prey relying on litter derived resources such as fungal feeding Collembola. Related taxa often had distinctively different isotope ratios suggesting that trophic niche partitioning facilitates coexistence of morphologically similar species. Unexpectedly, the trophic position of Mesostigmata species was not related to body size reflecting the varying trophic position of their main prey, nematodes and Collembola, suggesting that body size is a poor predictor of trophic position in soil food webs.},

Much of the previous information on interactions between Collembola and ECM has been based on mycelium grown in pure culture, which has artificially high nutrient levels and may lack physical and chemical grazing deterrents seen when ECM form on plant roots. We investigated Collembola feeding preferences by offering naturally occurring ECM, identified by ITS sequencing, to Folsomia candida and Protaphorura armata. We also assessed the gut content fungi of Folsomia collected in a mature Pinus strobus stand. We found that some ECM types, including the Tricholoma aestuans, Piloderma bicolor and the tuburculate ECM of Suillus spraguei, were readily grazed, while Cenococcum geophilum and Lactarius vinaceorufescens were unpalatable. Fungi forming unpalatable ECM were readily grazed when not in symbiosis with the host root.},

Among the predators, found in association with R. robini in the field and under storage conditions, mesostigmatic mites predominate. The most abundant species were Hypoaspis aculeifer (Canestrini), Lasioseius bispinosus Evans and Parasitus fimetorum (Berlese). These predators appeared to feed and reproduce on a diet of exclusively R. robini and they were able to control the bulb mite in small-scale population experiments initiated with a 1:20 predator-prey ratio. Under laboratory conditions corresponding to lily bulb propagation (lily scales mixed with vermiculite and stored at 23\textdegree C and {$>$}90\% RH) the laelapid mite, H. aculeifer, was the most effective predator; the ascid predator, L. bispinosus, was much less effective, but being relatively small and being successful in attacking the juvenile stages of the bulb mite it may be better able to search for bulb mites hidden inside the lily bulb. The parasitid predator, P. fimetorum, failed to control the bulb mite when vermiculite was used as a medium, but turned out to suppress this prey when peat was used instead. Various strains of H. aculeifer or closely related species were compared with respect to their impact and performance on bulb mites as prey: two Dutch strains, one obtained from Breezand and the other from 'tZand, a Taiwanese strain, a German strain that in contrast to the previously mentioned strains was not collected from lily bulbs, but from agricultural areas near Bremen and, in addition, a Canadian strain of a related species (Hypoaspis miles Berlese), known to control sciarid fly larvae. These comparative experiments showed that H. miles died out without noticeable impact on the bulb mite population whereas all strains of H. aculeifer were able to suppress the bulb mites to very low numbers. However, the numerical responses of the H. aculeifer strains differed in that those collected in association with the pest (Breezand {$>$} Taiwan {$>$} 'tZand) were superior to the strain from Bremen. These results do not provide support to the Hokkanen and Pimentel hypothesis, which states that predators forming an evolutionary new association with the pest are often more effective in biological control.},

Attack rates were derived and prey selection examined in maritime Antarctic communities at Signy Island. (2) During summer, c. 86\% of the predator population had detectable prey traces. The species composition of these traces in Gamasellus from three major habitat types reflected the proportions of prey observed in the field community, although there were differences between the life-stages of Gamasellus. The collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus (CR) formed c. 80\% of all prey traces. (3) The non-feeding component of the predator population was stable at c. 14\% despite the 10-fold range in Cryptopygus densities between moss-turf, fellfield and ornithogenic sites. (4) Data from field and laboratory experiments showed no detectable functional response over a 300-fold range in prey density. Attack rates upon Cryptopygus calculated by quantitative electrophoresis analysis of field samples confirm this. (5) In laboratory experiments, Gamasellus presented with different size-classes of prey showed maximum attack rates of c. 4 Cryptopygus per predator per day (CR/GA day-1), decreasing with prey size to as little as 0.1 CR/GA day-1 or less for juveniles and c. 0.2 CR/GA day-1 for adults. Mean field attack rates calculated by electrophoresis analysis were more consistent at 0.2 CR/GA day-1 for protonymphs and deutonymphs and 0.4 CR/GA day-1 for adults. These attack rates would easily be sustainable at the lowest field densities of Cryptopygus (c. 1 cm-2) ever likely to be encountered by Gamasellus at Signy Island. (6) Experiments using mixtures of two prey (Cryptopygus and a second collembolan, Parisotoma octooculata) showed that Gamasellus prefers the former species, with feeding being maximal at the ratio of 4 Cryptopygus: 1 Parisotoma. Live weight gain of the predator is also greatest at this ratio. (7) The data validate the method of Lister, Usher \& Block (1987) for the quantification of field attack rates by predatory micro-arthropods. They are discussed in relation to the strategies adopted by an invertebrate predator to maintain its population in extreme habitats containing few prey species.}

Also, six microfungi from similar fungal taxa which were isolated from the F-horizon of Solling (Cladosporium cladosporioides, Mortierella ramanniana, Mortierella parvispora, Mucor hiemalis, Penicillium sp.2 and a sterile dark form) were offered simultaneously and separately to three species of oribatid mites from this site (Cepheus dentatus, Nothrus silvestris and Hypochthonius rufulus). Feeding choice experiments were carried out separately for each oribatid mite species. Generally, oribatid mites from the two different forests preferred similar microfungal taxa as food substrate. The ranking of fungal taxa was very similar in tests where fungi had been offered simultaneously and separately. The oribatid mites studied preferred dark, pigmented fungi (Dematiacea) to hyaline forms. The reason for this preference remains speculative; food quality of dematiaceous fungi might be superior to that of hyaline fungi or oribatid mites may prefer to feed on dematiaceous fungi because they produce more effective exoenzymes ('external rumen'). Despite the general preference for dematiaceous fungi, food selectivity of the oribatid mite species studied differed and the species were ranked in respect to their food specialization: Steganacarus magnus {$>$} Acrogalumna longipluma {$>$} Cepheus dentatus {$>$} Nothrus silvestris {$>$} Hypodamaeus riparius {$>$} Hypochthonius rufulus.

Our aims are (a) to recapitulate the history of stable isotope research in soil animals with a focus on oribatid mites, (b) to present new stable isotope data for oribatid mites and overview the current state of knowledge of oribatid mite trophic niche differentiation, (c) to compile problems and limitations of stable isotope based analyses of trophic relationships and (d) to suggest future challenges, questions and problems that may be solved using stable isotope analyses and other novel techniques for improving our understanding on the trophic ecology of soil invertebrates. We conclude that (1) in addition to 15N/14N ratios, 13C/12C ratios contribute to our understanding of the trophic ecology of oribatid mites, allowing, e.g. separation of lichen- and moss-feeding species, (2) there likely are many lichen but few moss feeding oribatid mite species, (3) oribatid mite species that are endophagous as juveniles are separated by their stable isotope signatures from all other oribatid mite species, (4) fungivorous oribatid mite species cannot be separated further, e.g. the fungal taxa they feed on cannot be delineated. A particular problem in using stable isotope data is the difficulty in determining signatures for basal food resources, since decomposing material, fungi and lichens comprise various components differing in stable isotope signatures; 13C/12C ratios and potentially other isotopes may help in identifying the role of these resources for decomposer animal nutrition.},

  abstract = {Shifting of trophic niches of soil microarthropods may allow them to adapt to changing resource conditions as induced by global change processes. However, the capability of microarthropods to shift their trophic niches is little studied. Whereas some studies based on stable isotopes (15N/13C) point to distinct and narrow trophic niches, others indicate that trophic niches are plastic. Here, we investigated shifts in trophic niches of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari), a major soil detritivore microarthropod group, due to forest management, i.e., plantation of beech and spruce forests in Central Europe, using neutral lipid fatty acid (NLFA) markers. Due to differential microbial communities, we expected a fungi-based diet of oribatid mites in beech forest, but more bacterial contributions to the diet in spruce forest. Supporting these hypotheses, NLFA markers indicated that the trophic niches of each of the studied oribatid mite species differed between beech and spruce forests and shifted from feeding predominantly on litter and fungi in beech forest to more intensively feeding on bacteria in spruce forest. Oribatid mite species with the most pronounced differences in trophic niches included Achipteria coleoptrata, Eupelops hirtus, Eupelops plicatus and Liacarus xylariae, which had been classified as primary or secondary decomposers in previous studies. Overall, the results indicate that the ability of oribatid mite species to colonize different habitats and ecosystems is due to their ability to adjust their diet, i.e., to trophic plasticity. Changes in trophic niches in each of the studied oribatid mite species suggest that detritivores in soil may better cope with future changes in environmental conditions and associated changes in resource composition than species above the ground.},

Ceratozetes kananaskis, Ceratozetes gracilis, and Scheloribates spp. were predominant in the fermentation (F) and humus (H) horizons while Eremaeus spp. and Eupterotegaeus rostratus were restricted to the litter (L) horizon. In laboratory studies the five mite taxa were fed and reared upon the seven most common fungal species which had been isolated from the aspen soil. The mite inhabitants of the F and H\textemdash horizons showed variation in amount of feeding and reproductive success among the fungi tested. There was no direct relationship between the amount of mite feeding and reproductive success on any given fungus. The L inhabitants fed very little on fungus in culture and showed no reproduction. Gut content analyses from field specimens showed that all taxa fed on fungi and demonstrated that laboratory feeding studies were a poor indication of feeding type. All taxa fed predominately on the pigmented fungi with the F and H inhabitants showing a higher proportion of hyaline fungi than the L inhabitants; this difference was probably related to the fungal distribution in the soil. Seasonal variation in amount of gut contents was directly related to a postulated level of microbial activity in the soil. Only 2\% of the fungal standing crop would be consumed in 1 yr by the total oribatid mite community emphasizing the importance of assessing the effect of the oribatid mites in conjunction with the other mycophagous members of the soil fauna. Possible interactions between oribatid mites and the fungal community were given and the consequences of the interactions related to organic matter decomposition.},

  abstract = {Mountain scree habitats are intermediate habitats between the base of the soil and the bedrock. They are composed of a network of small cracks and voids, and are commonly situated at the lower levels of scree slopes. Their environment is defined by empty spaces inside the scree, the absence of light and photoperiod, low temperature, and resource poor conditions. Soil arthropod communities, their trophic structure as well as their use of basal resources in mountain scree are little studied despite the fact that they are important components of these systems. Here, we investigate stable isotope ratios (15N/14N, 13C/12C) of oribatid mites (Oribatida, Acari) to understand their trophic niches and their~variation with depth (50 and 75~cm) at two mountain scree sites (Cerdacul Stanciului, Marele Grohotis) in the Romanian Carpathians. Further, we used existing data to investigate the reproductive mode of the species in that habitat, as this may be related to resource availability. We hypothesized that trophic niches of oribatid mites will not differ between the two mountain scree regions but will be affected by depth. We furthermore hypothesized that due to the resource poor conditions oribatid mite species will span a narrow range of trophic levels, and that species are sexual rather than parthenogenetic. Our results showed that (1) oribatid mite trophic structure only slightly differed between the two sites indicating that the trophic ecology of oribatid mites in scree habitats is consistent and predictable, (2) oribatid mite trophic structure did not differ between the two studied soil depths indicating that the structure and availability of resources that were used by oribatid mites in deeper scree habitats varies little with depth, (3) oribatid mite species spanned only three trophic levels indicating that the habitat is rather resource poor, and (4) that all studied oribatid mite species were sexual supporting the view that resource poor conditions favour sexual reproduction.},

In recent years authenticated cases of attacks on man have shown the need for accurate information on feeding habits in this genus. Observations by the writer and others show that species of Balaustium have very generalized feeding habits. Food sources include pollen, leaf tissues, and insects. Man is also attacked, probably in situations which bring numbers of Balaustium into incidental contact with potential human victims. Symptoms of attack vary widely, probably as a result of individual susceptibility, or possibly with the species of Balaustium involved. Information on the latter point is not available at present because of the inadequate state of our knowledge of the systematics of this genus.}

  abstract = {Compound specific stable isotope analysis (13C/12C ratio of fatty acids) was used to assess the allocation of plant carbon in soil microbiota, and to identify the trophic links to microbial grazers in an arable field with long-term mineral and organic fertilizer amendments. The feeding strategy of two dominant Collembola species, epedaphic Isotoma viridis and euedaphic Willemia anophthalma was determined. The investigation was conducted following a shift to amaranth, a C4 plant, after 27years of continuous C3 crop rotation. The influence of new C4 plant carbon was observed in microbial phospholipids (PLFAs) with higher {$\delta$}13C recorded in C4 amaranth than in C3 clover soils. The strongest enrichment occurred in the fungal PLFA 18:2{$\omega$}6,9c and bacterial PLFA 18:1{$\omega$}9t with 11.2\textperthousand{} and 6.6\textperthousand, respectively. However, other bacterial PLFAs showed no isotopic change, suggesting that the microbial community simultaneously utilized ``new'' and ``old'' plant carbon. The {$\delta$}13C of Collembola fatty acids displayed species specific lipid pattern, which was affected by crop type, but not fertilizer amendments. Isotopic separation of Collembola lipids from amaranth and clover plots was more distinct in I. viridis than W. anophthalma. With up to 18\textperthousand, the enrichment in Collembola lipids was stronger than in microbial PLFAs, pointing to a distinct incorporation of carbon resources originating from the actual plant residues. The {$\delta$}13C pattern in I. viridis indicated trophic links with bacteria, saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues, while saprotrophic fungi and plant tissues were accountable for the patterns observed in W. anophthalma.},

Single adult individuals of six different oribatid mite species (Steganacarus magnus; Nothrus silvestris; Damaeus riparius; Liacarus coracinus; Eupelops plicatus; Achipteria coleoptrata), one collembolan species (Folsomia quadrioculata) and juvenile Pergamasus spp. were offered separately to adult P. septentrionalis in a no-choice feeding experiment. The predators quickly and preferentially fed on collembolans and juvenile Pergamasus; three oribatid mite species were occasionally eaten (L. coracinus, N. silvestris, A. coleoptrata); the other oribatid mite species were rejected as food (E. plicatus, S. magnus, H. riparius). When preying on oribatid mites, P. septentrionalis typically first cut off the legs of the mite, then opened the body through the region of the genital plates or the mouthparts. The results suggest that predator pressure on adult oribatid mites in the field is low, since few relevant predators at the study site are more abundant and powerful than P. septentrionalis. Adult oribatid mites therefore likely indeed live in enemy-free space, i.e. are little affected by predators, but that may not apply to soft-bodied immatures. Collembolans were quickly consumed indicating that they comprise a major part of the diet of P. septentrionalis. Strong feeding on juveniles of Pergamasus suggests that P. septentrionalis also functions as an intra-guild predator.},

  abstract = {The soil animal food web has become a focus of recent ecological research but trophic relationships still remain enigmatic for many taxa. Analysis of stable isotope ratios of N and C provides a powerful tool for disentangling food web structure. In this study, animals, roots, soil and litter material from a temperate deciduous forest were analysed. The combined measurement of {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}13C provided insights into the compartmentalization of the soil animal food web. Leaf litter feeders were separated from animals relying mainly on recent belowground carbon resources and from animals feeding on older carbon. The trophic pathway of leaf litter-feeding species appears to be a dead end, presumably because leaf litter feeders (mainly diplopods and oribatid mites) are unavailable to predators due to large size and/or strong sclerotization. Endogeic earthworms that rely on older carbon also appear to exist in predator-free space. The data suggest that the largest trophic compartment constitutes of ectomycorrhizal feeders and their predators. Additionally, there is a smaller trophic compartment consisting of predators likely feeding on enchytraeids and potentially nematodes.},

  abstract = {Soil microarthropods are essential for nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems as they are integral components of decomposer food webs. They channel carbon and nutrients from leaf litter and roots to higher trophic levels; however, knowledge on the relative importance of different channels and on their variation with forest type is lacking. Although the importance of root-derived inputs for sustaining soil food webs is increasingly recognized, the pathways by which they are channeled to higher trophic levels are little understood. For the channeling, ectomycorrhizal fungi may play a significant role, but until now methods allowing to separate the contribution of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi to the nutrition of soil animal communities are lacking. Using dual analysis of 15N and 13C in amino acids (AAs), we investigated trophic positions and basal resources of two major groups of soil microarthropods, Collembola and Oribatida, in beech and spruce forests in Germany. By applying a 13C fingerprinting approach and Bayesian mixing models, we separated in a first step the relative contribution of bacteria, fungi, and plants to the nutrition of soil microarthropods. As fungi were identified as the major food source, in a second step we attempted to separate the contribution of ectomycorrhizal vs. saprotrophic fungi. For the first time, we provide direct evidence that soil microarthropods mainly rely on saprotrophic fungi, whereas ectomycorrhizal fungi are consumed by only few species. While trophic niches of Collembola and Oribatida species generally varied little between beech and spruce forests, plant detritus as basal resource of soil microarthropods was somewhat more important in beech forests, whereas in spruce forests microbial resources dominated. Overall, the dual analysis of carbon and nitrogen in AAs provided insight into food web structure of soil microarthropods in unprecedented detail, and for the first time allowed to estimate the relative importance of mycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi for soil food web nutrition, a long-standing riddle in soil food web ecology. The technique provides the perspective for a comprehensive understanding of the trophic structure and energy channeling in soil food webs.},

  abstract = {This paper is the third in a series, the aim of which is to demonstrate the value of micromorphological investigations in soil ecological studies. After microstratification of a soil sample from a Scots pine stand (For\^et d'Orl\'eans, Loiret, France), the F1 layer was studied using the following procedures: 1. Sorting the different components under adissecting microscope, 2. Counting and measuring soil animaIs, observing their digestive tract by clearing or after dissection, and by mounting their faeces, 3. Thin-sectioning different types of vegetation,observing these sections under a light microscope with an appropriate stain procedure. The principal results from this study concern the de composition of pine needles, twigs and bark, ecto-mycorrhizae and their associate mycelia (Cenococcum geophilum and several basidiomycetes), decomposition of mosses (Pseudoscleropodium pururn), bracken leaves and animal bodies in the F1 layer. All the observed needles are comminuted by members of the soil fauna, with different modalities according to their alimentary behaviour. Macrofaunal species (primarily the epigeic lumbricid worm Dendrobaena octaedra) break the needles and ingest entire pieces of vegetation. They make holes which allow both the microfauna (amoebae, nematoda and also some testacea) and mycorrhizal fungi to enter. The same phenomenon can be observed in moss stems and bracken petioles. Lumbricidae are able to crush the pine material and to mix it with other organic elements. Unlike them, woodlice and slugs do not crush the needles, which can be found without any structural change in their faeces,only protoplasm appearing to be digested. Macrofaunal faeces do not seem to promote any bacterial development except at their periphery, unless the excrements are squashed by animal movements, in which case they become more suitable for bacterial contamination. Among the mesofaunal groups, oribatid mites (mainly phthiracarids and euphthiracarids), enchytraeid worms and diptera larvae (sciarids) are very active in tunnelling the needles. Phthiracarid and euphthiracarid mites are specialized feeders on this type of food, while enchytraeids and also, but to a lesser extent, sciarid larvae are more omnivorous. Other oribatid species consume fungal mycelium almost exclusively. Among the Collembola (springtails), the Isotomidae, represented by the three ubiquitous species Parisotoma notabilis, Folsomia manolachei and Isomiella minor, seem to consume only excremental material, while two strongly acidophilic species, Pseudosinella terricola and Willemia anophthalma, consume only fungal hyphae. Cell wall material is probably hydrolyzed, at least partly, by some mesofaunal groups but a distrinction must be made between the three categories: hyaline fungal walls, melanized (dematiaceous) fungal walls, and higher plant cell walls. Hyaline fungal walls seem to be digested by aIl groups except sciarid larvae. Melanized walls are transformed (and perhaps digested to some extent?) only by oribatid mites (mostly camisiid mites), while higher plant cell walls seem to be (at least partly) digested only by sciarid larvae, phthiracarid and euphthiracarid mites, with a distinct browning during passage through the post-colon in the latter two groups. Early wood in the pine twigs is attacked by soft-rot fungi which develop their typical cavitieswithin the S2 layer of tracheid walls. Similar decay pathways were also recorded in pieces of pine bark, moss leaves and bracken petioles.The decomposition of fine roots was also studied and the role of mycorrhizal fungi as prime root invaders at, or prior to root death, is discussed. Generally speaking there seems to be a regression in the development of bacteria (in comparison with the L1 and L2 layers), while mycorrhizal associated mycelia grow not only at the periphery of decaying fragments (as in the L layers), but also through the vegetation tissues.},

Collembolans inhabit different litter and soil layers and their food objects are intimately related to their habitat. Morphological differences that separate high rank taxa of collembolans have clear functional meaning in relation to life style and habitat requirements (including position in the soil profile). However, no study has tested the hypothesis that the species within the major functional groups also differ in terms of trophic positions. This hypothesis was tested for the first time using stable isotope analysis. We compiled original and published data on the stable isotope composition of 82 collembolan species in temperate forest ecosystems. The {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of collembolans were found related to their life forms, reflecting a shift in available food objects across different habitat layers and matching the vertical isotopic gradient of soil organic matter. The trophic niche of species varied among different collembolan orders and families, indicating a pronounced phylogenetic signal and supporting the trophic niche conservatism hypothesis. Considering stable isotope compositions, as well as the taxonomic identity and life form of species, we outlined four collembolan functional guilds that use different types of food and perform different ecosystem functions.},

Implementing conservation and/or classical biocontrol tactics could enhance densities of specialist or generalist predatory mites and lead to pest suppression, but first relevant mite species must be identified and their predatory capabilities evaluated. We conducted lab assays to quantify consumption of immature rootworms and oviposition rates of various mite species. Our study indicates that rootworms are a sub-optimal food source for the mite taxa tested. However, all mite species fed upon rootworms to some degree, although consumption by nematophagous Eviphis ostrinus was extremely low. Predators consumed more rootworm larvae than eggs, and mite size was correlated with prey consumption, with larger predators eating more prey. Four mite taxa (Gaeolaelaps sp., S. miles, Gl. americana, and G. aculeifer) had detrimental effects on survival of rootworm larvae, and the latter two species also had negative impacts on densities of pest eggs. Although it is unlikely that any of these mite species by itself has a major impact on rootworm control, the community of generalist soil-dwelling mites may play an important role in regulating immature rootworm populations in the field.},

Top-down control by micro-arthropod predators may have a significant impact on nematode population dynamics. We report experiments showing that mites and Collembola were capable of reducing nematode numbers in the laboratory and were feeding on a targeted nematode species in the field. A PCR-based approach was developed for the detection of predation on three species of slug- and insect-pathogenic nematodes: Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema feltiae. The collembolan Folsomia candida and the mesostigmatid mite Stratiolaelaps miles were employed as model predators to calibrate post-ingestion prey DNA detection times. Fragments of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA were sequenced and species-specific primers were designed, amplifying 154-, 154- and 203-bp fragments for each of the nematode species. Detection times for nematode DNA within the guts of Collembola were longer than in mites, with half-lives (50\% of samples testing positive) of 08.75 h and 05.03 h, respectively. F. candida significantly reduced numbers of the nematode H. megidis, with rates of predation of {$\sim$}0.4 nematode infective juveniles per collembolan per hour over 10 h. Four taxa of field-caught micro-arthropod that had been exposed to the nematode P. hermaphrodita for a period of 12 h were analysed and significant numbers of three taxa tested positive. This is the first application of PCR techniques for the study of nematophagy and the first time these techniques have been used to measure predation on nematodes in the field.},

We used three already established girdling experiments in northern Sweden, one in a Pinus sylvestris stand and two in Picea abies stands, to determine the effect of tree girdling on soil-living oribatid mites. These mites often feed on fungal hyphae, but it is not known to what extent they feed on EM or saprotrophic fungi. We hypothesised that a presumed decline in EM fungi after girdling would strongly reduce EM-feeding specialists and, correspondingly, reduce total abundance and species richness of oribatids in girdled plots. Tree girdling resulted in a significant decline in total abundance of oribatid mites in the two spruce stands, which was assumed to be linked to the decline in EM fungi, but not in the pine stand. Species richness decreased in girdled plots in one of the spruce forests. The decline in total abundance in girdled spruce stands was primarily dependent on a significant and consistent population decrease in Oppiella nova, which was the most abundant oribatid mite in the ungirdled spruce plots. Its abundance after girdling was only 8\textendash 18\% of that in ungirdled spruce plots. In the pine stand, O. nova had much lower abundance than in the spruce stands, and despite a tendency to decline in number after girdling also in the pine stand, it had a minor effect on total abundance.

There are many checklists and catalogues of Collembola for smaller territories and entire continents. Biogeographical analyses have been made for some genera and smaller territories. The most serious problems for a global biogeographical analysis is the lack of enough records from immense territories of all continents. Local biodiversity of Collembola can be very high, reaching over 100 species in small mountain ranges. Sampling methods do not impede documenting biodiversity on a global scale. Collembola have well differentiated ecomorphological life-forms and feeding guilds which enable the functional role that Collembola play in ecosystems to be recognised in some degree. Collembola play an important role in plant litter decomposition processes and in forming soil microstructure. They are hosts of many parasitic Protozoa, Nematoda, Trematoda and pathogenic bacteria and in turn are attacked by different predators. They utilise as food Protozoa, Nematoda, Rotatoria, Enchytraeidae, invertebrate carrion, bacteria, fungi, algae, plant litter, live plant tissues, and some plant pathogens. Soil acidification, nitrogen supply, global climate change and intensive farming have greatly impacted collembolan diversity.},

Furthermore, moulting, growth, survival and reproduction of O. sinensis in the presence of each of the ten test fungi were studied. Mucor plumbeus and Trichothecium roseum were the most preferred whatever the culture substrate and their odour was the most attractive. Two fungi (Penicillium spinulosum and the Basidiomycete S41) attracted Collembola by their odour but were not preferred as food sources.

The natural variation of the stable isotopes 15N/14N was measured in 36 species/taxa from four beech and beech-oak forests. Signatures of {$\delta$}15N formed a gradient spanning over 12 {$\delta$} units suggesting that (a) different species occupy different trophic niches and (b) oribatid mites span three to four trophic levels. This study for the first time documented strong trophic niche differentiation in decomposer microarthropods.

The main aim of this study was to explore the importance of partitioning of food resources for the high diversity of micro-arthropods in soil. In addition, we investigated if ectomycorrhizal fungi are preferentially consumed compared to saprotrophic fungi. Until today, ectomycorrhizal fungi have never been tested as potential food resource for oribatid mites. We offered six ectomycorrhizal fungi [Amanita muscaria (L.) Hook., Boletus badius (Fr.) Fr., Cenococcum geophilum Fr., Laccaria laccata (Scop.) Fr., Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr. and Piloderma croceum J. Erikss. \& Hjortstam], one ericoid mycorrhizal fungus [Hymenoscyphus ericae (D.J. Read) Korf \& Kernan] and three saprotrophic fungi [Agrocybe gibberosa (Fr.) Fayod, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. and Mortierella ramanniana (A. M\"uller) Linnem.] simultaneously to each of the mainly mycophagous oribatid mite species Carabodes femoralis (Nicolet), Nothrus silvestris Nicolet and Oribatula tibialis Nicolet. The ericoid mycorrhizal fungus H. ericae and the ectomycorrhizal fungus B. badius were preferentially consumed by each oribatid mite species. However, feeding preferences differed significantly between the three species, with O. tibialis being most selective. This study for the first time documented that oribatid mites feed on certain ectomycorrhizal fungi.},

  abstract = {The introduction of white clover in grassland is a common practice to improve the quality of the pasture and to limit the use of industrial sources of inorganic fertilizer N inputs. However, little is known about the extent to which the introduction of different crop compositions affects soil quality in general, and soil biota in particular. Recent studies have shown that epedaphic and euedaphic Collembola can have distinct differences in feeding strategy that suggests trophic niche differentiation according to soil habitat. Combining fatty acid (FA) biomarkers with the carbon isotopic ratios technique, we investigated belowground trophic interactions. We compared the FA composition of the three most predominant groups of Collembola (Isotoma spp., Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Poduromorpha) and bulk soil in white clover-only, a grass-clover mixture, and grass-only plots. Differences between FA-{$\delta$}13C of Collembola groups and the FA-{$\delta$}13C signatures of potential food sources (plant material and soil microorganisms) were calculated to explore trophic links in the three cropping combinations. Collembola showed difference in FA compositions between groups. We observed a lower amount of neutral lipid fatty acids (NLFAs) in Isotoma spp. compared to L.~cyaneus. Poduromorpha showed a higher relative percentage of the NLFAs 16:1{$\omega$}7 and 20:4 compared to L.~cyaneus, and of 18:3 compared to Isotoma spp. The NLFA oleic/linoleic ratio (18:1{$\omega$}9/18:2{$\omega$}6,9) ratio was higher in Poduromorpha compared to L.~cyaneus in all the treatments. Soil FA analysis highlighted a larger fungal/bacterial ratio in grass compared to clover plots, while in Collembola no differences in the FA pattern were detected in relation to the treatments. Nevertheless, results of {$\delta$}13C fractionation in Collembola disclosed differences in the food sources used depending on the crop composition. Apparently, Isotoma spp. and L.~cyaneus fed on clover-related diet in clover plots and more on grass-related diet in mixture treatments while Poduromorpha fed more on a plant-related diet, such as leaf litter, in the mixture treatment. Our results suggest differentiation in Collembola feeding strategy and in the diet in relation to food availability and palatability.},

The ability of a species to digest available food items, and to endure relatively unfavourable conditions (drought), determine its habitat. This ability is particularly important when population densities are high, as in the case of juvenile life stages. The mites N. silvestris and P. peltifer, formerly considered panphytophagic, were shown to have different carbohydrase activities with regard to chitinase, trehalase, and cellulase. N. silvestris is a true panphytophage, but P. peltifer is a macrophytophage rather than a panphytophage.

  abstract = {Carbohydrase activity was analysed in 49 species of oribatid mites and one acaridid mite sampled from natural populations. Enzyme activity was determined for the main differentiating food components: cellulose, a component of cell-walls of green plants; chitin, a component of fungal cell-walls; and trehalose, a component of fungal cell-contents. Feeding guilds were defined based on the activity of the three carbohydrases. The nomenclature of the feeding guilds was adopted from that of ruminants. Five major feeding guilds were distinguished: herbivorous grazers (9 species), fungivorous grazers (8), herbo-fungivorous grazers (16), fungivorous browsers (7) and opportunistic herbo-fungivores (8) and two minor guilds in oribatids: herbivorous browsers (1) and omnivores (1). The feeding guilds presented are operationally better defined in terms of resource exploitation than the macro-, micro- and panphytophages used hitherto.},

  abstract = {Decline of soil microarthropod biodiversity is described in the sequence: old forest stands, low-input grasslands, high-input grasslands (with and without the use of persistent pesticides). With this expected trend of declining biodiversity, the patterns of species losses are analysed with the use of classifications of life-history tactics, feeding guilds and tolerances to drought. Species intolerant to drought are absent in grasslands, but present in old forest stands. Also the fraction of thelytokously reproducing microarthropods is higher in old forest stands compared with low-input grasslands. The main difference between low-input and high-input grasslands is found in the feeding guild structure of the community. Low-input grasslands are dominated by (herbo-) fungivorous grazers, whereas high-input grasslands are dominated by fungivorous browsers. Application of DDT in high-input grasslands shows a high density of microarthropods with a high fraction of thelytokous reproduction, associated with a decrease in genetic variation in a thelytokously reproducing species. Patterns in species losses, the species filters, are explained and discussed. It is shown that the decline of biodiversity is not a randorn loss of species but follows and identifiable pattern.},

Direct observations, histology, enzymology and plating techniques were employed to record contact with food, contents and structure of the alimentary tract, presence and viability of bacterial microorganisms inside the mite body, and chitinase and cellulase activity of mite homogenates. Algae were highly palatable, resulting in high apocrine secretion and guts that were continuously full. Initially there was no evidence of chitinase or cellulase production. Chitinase activity started after 10 days, probably due to consumption of fungi that invaded the algal cover, and correlated with the presence of chitinolytic bacteria (Serratia rubidea) in the mite homogenate. Alternaria was grazed intensively, but cell walls of spores and hyphae remained intact and no chitinase was detected suggesting that only cell contents were enzymatically digested. Stachybothrys sp. was rejected as food. The bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis was dominant in homogenates in each of the treatments, but under starvation Achromobacter xylosoxidans became co-dominant. Cellulase activity was not detected in any treatment, but strong chitinase activity was induced with a filter paper (colonized by invasive fungi) diet. Furthermore, bacteria were common in mesenchyme between the internal organs in the filter paper and starvation treatments.},

  abstract = {Two or three microhabitats were defined within each of several habitats within a forest. For example, if `tree' is a habitat, its microhabitats are the moss cover on the tree, the moss at the foot of the tree in contact with the soil, and the soil around the tree. The microhabitat community structure of oribatid mites was recorded. The nutritional biology, especially the type of food and the digestion pattern, of the more dominant species was monitored. Mites were extracted in Berlese-Tullgren funnels, collected in modified Bouin-Dubosque-Brasil fixation fluid, sectioned in paraplast, and stained with Masson triple. Faecal pellets in the rectum were also stained with acridine orange and observed under fluorescent light. Mite microanatomy was evaluated based on nutritional parameters (food bolus, food type, activity of the walls of the intestine, faecal pellets, bacteria within the body, nutritive deposits, metabolites). Some species consume and digest a specific type of food in all microhabitats of one habitat. But others are able to shift diet according to current food supply in a particular microhabitat. A third type of species is ubiquitous and usually consumes a mixture of unspecified food types in every microhabitat studied. Obligate mycophagous oribatids (e.g., Damaeus, Belba or Metabelba) seem to be highly specialized. These genera inhabit mostly soil or microhabitats in contact with soil (e.g., mosses on soil), and are rarely found in moss cover on trees, away from the soil. Other species inhabiting soil microhabitats as well as moss covers on trees (Achipteria coleoptrata, Hermannia gibba) can adapt to the nearly pure fungal food in soil microhabitats, although they graze on a different type of food in a microhabitat consisting of moss covering a tree.},

Previously published data and Layman's metrics were used to compare the structure of the `isotopic trophic niches' and the range of resources used by Oribatida in the tropical forest to those observed in temperate forests. The range of trophic levels occupied by oribatid mites, as reflected in their nitrogen isotopic compositions, did not differ between tropical and temperate forests. In contrast, the range of {$\delta$}13C values of oribatid mites in the tropical community was smaller than that typically observed in temperate forests. This was due to the lack of 13C-enriched species with strongly calcified integuments. The diversity of trophic niches and the range of resources consumed did not differ between temperate and tropical communities of Oribatida. Moreover, similar {$\delta$}15N values were observed for oribatid mite families across temperate and tropical ecosystems, suggesting that the taxonomic system of soil- and litter-dwelling Oribatida is ecologically consistent and supporting the `taxonomic sufficiency' principle.},

  abstract = {Studies on the food selection of Onychiurus fimatus Gisin (Onychiuridae, Collembola), a seedling pest of sugar beet The food selection of Onychiurus fimatus among sugar beet and other food materials was investigated under laboratory conditions. The extent of ingestion of sugar-beet seedlings by O. fimatus was largely determined by the supply of alternative food. From 18 weed-species tested nearly all induced a reduction of the number of Collembola aggregating in the root zone of sugar-beet seedlings. The germinating seeds (radicles visible) of the weeds caused a greater protection of the sugar-beet seedlings than the cotyledon stages. Most weed-species showed less attraction to O. fimatus than sugar beet. An abundant supply of weeds outside of a 15 cm wide, weed-free area surrounding the sugar-beet seedlings caused a strong decrease in the number of Collembola damaging the seedlings. Soil fungi (Phoma, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Alternaria, Apbanomyces) were distinctly preferred to the seedlings by O. fimatus. Antagonistic interactions between O. fimatus and plant-pathogenic soil fungi at seedling-attack were discovered. The damage of sugar-beet seedlings was also influenced by the organic material in the soil, which served as an alternative source of food for the Collembola or as a substrate for the microorganisms. Depending on the amount, type and degree of decomposition of the organic material added (straw, alfalfa, decayed plant material) the attack of O. fimatus to beet seedlings was decreased. Zusammenfassung In Laboruntersuchungen wurde die Nahrungswahl von O. fimatus zwischen Ruben und anderen N\"ahrsubstraten gepr\"uft. Die Intensit\"at des Angriffs von O. fimatus auf R\"ubenkeimlinge wurde weitgehend vom Angebot an Alternativnahrung bestimmt. Von 18 gepr\"uften Unkraut- und Ungrasarten trugen fast alle zu einer Verringerung der Collembolenzahlen an den R\"uben bei. Das Keimlingsstadium f\"uhrte zu einer st\"arkeren Entlastung der R\"uben als das Keimblattstadium. Die meisten Arten besa\ss en allerdings eine geringere Attraktivit\"at f\"ur O. fimatus als die R\"ube. Durch reichliches Angebot von Unkr\"autern au\ss erhalb einer 15 cm breiten, unkrautfreien Fl\"ache um die R\"uben wurde die Zahl der die R\"ube angreifenden Tiere aber stark reduziert. Bodenpilze der Gattungen Phoma, Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Altemaria und Aphanomyces wurden von O. fimatus gegen\"uber R\"ubenkeimlingen deutlich bevorzugt aufgenommen. Zwischen O. fimatus und pflanzenpathogenen Bodenpilzen bestanden beim Angriff auf die R\"ube antagonistische Wechselbeziehungen. Die organische Substanz des Bodens \"ubte als Alternativnahrung oder als Substrat f\"ur die Mikroorganismen ebenfalls einen Einflu\ss{} auf die Sch\"adigung der R\"uben aus. Je nach Menge, Art und Zersetzungsgrad der zugef\"uhrten Stoffe (Stroh, Luzerne, Ernter\"uckst\"ande) verringerte sich der Angriff von O. fimatus auf die R\"ubenkeimlinge.},

By 1959 the infestation had spread over 50,000 ha and methods of control were examined. The predatory mite B. lapidaria was known to be an effective biological control agent against S. viridis in Australian pastures. From 1963 to 1966 over 75,000 mites were collected in Western Australia and sent by air for immediate release in selected sites in South Africa (Cape Province). The mites were shown to be established in 1965 and multiplied rapidly, enabling redistribution to additional sites. The influence of this predator on S. viridis numbers is now being monitored. Preliminary data indicate that B. lapidaria is capable of influencing flea densities under South African conditions. A definite relationship between the predator and sminthurid Collembola such as S. viridis slnd Bourletiella arvalis is indicated, although B. lapidaria appears to be able to utilize other foods during periods of sminthurid scarcity.},

  abstract = {Free-living nematodes may be attacked and eaten by soil mites which are normally considered fungivores or saprophages. Three species in the genus Tyrophagus, common inhabitants of grassland soils and also common pests in stored products, museums and laboratories, are predators of nematodes. All active stages of the mites will voraciously consume nematodes. When offered nematodes and a choice of other food (baker's yeast and algae), 11\% of the Tyrophagus putrescentiae, 23\% of the T. zachvatkini, and 56\% of the T. similis tested fed on nematodes. Tyrophagus zechvatkini and similis were reared on a diet consisting entirely of nematodes, and developed at rates similar to a fungal diet and produced viable offspring. Agar cultures of Aphelenchus avenae which were inoculated with five mating pairs of Tyrophagus zachvatkini had populations that were one-third less than mite-free controls. Observations indicate that nematodes may be attacked by tyrophagid mites when in a dry, anhydrobiotic state.},

  abstract = {Nematodes are an important food resource for many species of soil arthropods. At an intensively studied site in the shortgrass steppe of western Nebraska, at least 33 species of arthropods fed on nematodes. Observations for soil arthopods from other shortgrass steppe sites in Colorado, Wyoming and New Mexico, from Chihuahuan desert sites in New Mexico and Texas and from montane litter habitats in Colorado indicate similar patterns of nematophagy. Nematophages include species of parasitiform mites in the families Zerconidae, Ologamasidae, Parasitidae, Laelapidae, Ascidae, Rhodacaridae, Macrochelidae, Eviphididae, Phytoseiidae and Veigaiidae; and acariform mites in the families Alycidae, Alicorhagiidae, Tydeidae, Eupodidae, Paratydeidae, Acaridae, Galumnidae, Haplozetidae and Ceratozetidae. Families of prostigmatid mites traditionally considered predatory are restricted to arthropod prey, and do not feed on nematodes. Some species of Collembola, Coleoptera, Symphyla and possibly small centipedes also feed on nematodes. Nematophagous arthropods fall into 3 trophic classes: (1) omnivores which feed on a variety of algae and fungi as well as on nematodes; (2) general predators of soil invertebrates; (3) nematode specialists. Some omnivores and general predators develop more rapidly and produce more offspring on a diet of nematodes than on other foods. Some mesostigmatid mites are small (allowing access to small pore spaces), have relatively rapid generation times and high reproductive outputs, prefer nematode prey (but can utilize alternative food sources) and are easily cultured. These animals have potential for development as biological-control agents for plant-parasitic nematodes.},

Ecologists have assumed that the function of invertebrates in soil systems can be predicted at a low level of taxonomic resolution, but our research indicates that critical functional parameters -- e.g., feeding behavior, developmental rate, and reproductive mode -- are rarely predictable above the generic level. Since morphology is more strongly conserved than behavior, feeding guilds or functional groups based on broad taxonomic relationship or untested assumptions about correlations between trophic morphology and feeding behavior have little meaning for nematophagous arthropods from grassland soils in Colorado.},

A new genus, Heatherella, and family, Heatherellidae, are proposed to accommodate two such new species, H. acanthocharis and H. callimaulos, that feed on nematodes and inhabit subtropical rainforest litter in southeast Queensland. Both mites share a number of derived character states otherwise unknown in the Mesostigmata, e.g. the opisthosoma is ringed by nine pairs of spout-like gland openings; the stigmatal opening is contained within a raised, spiky turret; the adults have three setose pygidial shields, and a unique circumventral shield surrounds the intercoxal region. The relationships of the Heatherellidae appear to be closest to the Uropodina; however, the new family lacks major uropodine synapomorphies and shares characters with Epicriina, Microgyniina, and Zerconina (none of which are known to occurin Australia).},

Living arthropods, nematodes, snails and annelids were ignored, but dead arthropods were readily fed upon and were sufficient to maintain adults and nymphs for many months. The adults were sluggish, timid animals that relied on armour, thanatosis and probably on noxious chemicals for protection: the juveniles produced secretions from idiosomal glands. In contrast, most early derivative Mesostigmata that we tested (Sejina, species of Sejus and Uropodella; Uropodina, Polyaspis sp. and Cercomegistina, an undescribed Asternoseiidae) were aggressive predators of small invertebrates and ingested fluids only; however, two species of Asternolaelaps (Sejina) had solid fungal and animal material in their guts. Similarly, the early derivative acariform (Palaeosomata, species of Stomacarus and Loftacarus) and opilioacariform mites (an undescribed Opilioacarida from Australia) that we examined all ingested particulate foods, including fungal and animal material. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the earliest mites were scavengers and opportunistic predators that ingested solid foods and that fluid feeding is a derived condition linking the three orders of Parasitiformes (Holothyrida, Ixodida and Mesostigmata).},
