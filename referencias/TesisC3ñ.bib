  abstract = {There is a vast diversity of organisms that live in the soil, and the activities of the total soil biota, together with the diverse forms and functions of plant roots, have critical roles in soil functioning. In this paper I discuss the likely determinants of soil diversity and also comment on recent studies that have explored whether or not there is a relationship between soil organism diversity and ecosystem function. There is little evidence to suggest that soil diversity is regulated in a predicable fashion by competition or disturbance; rather it is attributed to the nature of the soil environment, in that soil offers an extremely heterogeneous habitat, both spatially and temporally, proving unrivalled potential for niche partitioning, or resource or habitat specialisation, thereby enabling co-existence of species. Most evidence that is available suggests that there is no predictable relationship between diversity and function in soils, and that ecosystem properties are governed more by individual traits of dominant species, and by the extraordinary complexity of biotic interactions that occur between components of soil food webs. There is evidence of redundancy in soil communities with respect to soil functions, but the scale of effect of changes in soil diversity on process rates depends on which species are removed from the community and the degree to which remaining species can compensate. As in aboveground communities, therefore, it would appear that species traits and changes in species composition, and alterations in the nature of the many important species interactions that occur in soil, are likely to be the main biotic control of ecosystem function. In view of this, consideration of these important biotic interactions and their sensitivity to environmental change must be a key priority for future research.},

  abstract = {The soil environment is likely the most complex biological community. Soil organisms are extremely diverse and contribute to a wide range of ecosystem services that are essential to the sustainable function of natural and managed ecosystems. The soil organism community can have direct and indirect impacts on land productivity. Direct impacts are those where specific organisms affect crop yield immediately. Indirect effects include those provided by soil organisms participating in carbon and nutrient cycles, soil structure modification and food web interactions that generate ecosystem services that ultimately affect productivity. Recognizing the great biological and functional diversity in the soil and the complexity of ecological interactions it becomes necessary to focus in this paper on soil biota that have a strong linkage to functions which underpin `soil based' ecosystem services. Selected organisms from different functional groups (i.e. microsymbionts, decomposers, elemental transformers, soil ecosystem engineers, soil-borne pest and diseases, and microregulators) are used to illustrate the linkages of soil biota and ecosystem services essential to life on earth as well as with those associated with the provision of goods and the regulation of ecosystem processes. These services are not only essential to ecosystem function but also a critical resource for the sustainable management of agricultural ecosystems. Research opportunities and gaps related to methodological, experimental and conceptual approaches that may be helpful to address the challenge of linking soil biodiversity and function to the provision of ecosystem services and land productivity are discussed. These include: 1) integration of spatial variability research in soil ecology and a focus on `hot spots' of biological activity, 2) using a selective functional group approach to study soil biota and function, 3) combining new and existing methodological approaches that link selected soil organisms, the temporal and spatial dynamics of their function, and their contribution to the provision of selected `soil based' ecosystem services, 4) using understanding about hierarchical relationships to manage soil biota and function in cropping systems, 5) using local knowledge about plants as indicators of soil quality, remote sensing and GIS technologies, and plant-soil biota interactions to help understand the impacts of soil biota at landscape scale, and 6) developing land quality monitoring systems that inform land users about their land's ecosystem service performance, improve capacities to predict and adapt to environmental changes, and support policy and decision-making.},

  abstract = {The substrate-induced respiration (SIR) method was modified and adapted to measure fungal, bacterial and total microbial contributions to glucose-induced respiration and the potentially active microbial biomass on decaying plant residues of differing composition. Decomposing residues from natural and agricultural ecosystems were chopped and sieved to include the {$>$} 1 mm fraction for routine SIR analyses on a continuous flow-through respiration system. SIR procedures were optimized for sample size (0.5--1.0g dry wt), glucose concentration (80mg g-1), antibiotic concentrations (16mg streptomycin g-1; 80 mg cycloheximide g-1), total solution volume (5 ml), antibiotic preincubation conditions (12 h at 4 C), and total assay time following glucose addition (2--3 h). Analyses of antibiotic selectivities for target populations were made from agar plate culture experiments with mixed residue-microbial populations under in vitro and in situ exposure to antibiotics. The results support those concentrations optimized by SIR and emphasize the importance of independent analysis of antibiotic selectivity. Measures of fungal, bacterial and total SIR ({$\mu$}g CO2-C g-1 dry residue h-1) were linearly correlated (P{$<$}0.001) with biovolume-derived estimates of total (r2 = 0.91) and FDA-active (r2 = 0.93) fungal biomass, bacterial biomass (r2 = 0.87) and total microbial biomass (r2 = 0.91), respectively. Fungal to bacterial SIR ratios (1.6:1 to 2.5:1) emphasize the dominance of fungi in the early stages of plant residue decay ({$\leq$} 3 weeks). Plant residue SIR rates were 38--600 times greater than those of soils. Biomass specific SIR rates from plant residues (72 ng CO2 -Ch-1 {$\mu$}g-1 biomass-C) were 5-- 6 times higher than those reported from soil SIR. These findings suggest both a larger microbial biomass as well as a much higher proportion of physiologically active microorganisms on plant residues as compared to soils.},

  abstract = {Intensification of agricultural practices is leading to an increased rate of severe soil degradation in the central area of Argentina, with large areas being converted to arable lands. The application of different management practices to soil impacts edaphic mite populations by altering the organic inputs and by influencing the soil microhabitat. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the influence of three different land management practices on soil mite density in temperate agroecosystems of C{\'o}rdoba, Argentina, in comparison with a natural soil. Standard abiotic soil properties were also analyzed. Six samples per plot and per sampling date were taken at bimonthly intervals from August 1999 to June 2001. A gradient of increasing soil degradation was evident in physical, chemical and physicochemical soil properties from natural to agricultural plots. Total mite density decreased as soil cultivation increased. However, different responses to land management were observed when comparing the different suborders of mites. Oribatida and Mesostigmata were more sensitive to the agricultural practices than Prostigmata and Astigmata. Densities of the last two suborders seemed to be unaffected by soil cultivation in some periods. Oribatida, Mesostigmata and pooled mite density showed a hump-backed relationship with management intensity, with a maximum in the cattle management. It is concluded that the influence of soil cultivation on soil mites as a whole was negative, with more intensively managed systems tending to reduce mite density, although different suborders were differentially affected by agricultural intensification. We suggest that the reduction of total mite, Oribatida and Mesostigmata densities in the high-input managements is mainly explained by the perturbations produced by conventional agricultural practices and by environmental soil conditions present in the intensively managed sites that were unfavorable for these groups of mites. The implication of the changes reported in mite abundances on soil processes is discussed.},

  abstract = {We critically highlight some evidence for the importance of soil biodiversity to sustaining (agro-)ecosystem functioning and explore directions for future research. We first deal with resistance and resilience against abiotic disturbance and stress. There is evidence that soil biodiversity does confer stability to stress and disturbance, but the mechanism is not yet fully understood. It appears to depend on the kind of stress and disturbance and on the combination of stress and disturbance effects. Alternatively, community structure may play a role. Both possible explanations will guide further research. We then discuss biotic stress. There is evidence that soil microbial diversity confers protection against soil-borne disease, but crop and soil type and management also play a role. Their relative importance as well as the role of biodiversity in multitrophic interactions warrant further study. Henceforth, we focus on the effects of plant and soil biodiversity on nutrient and water use efficiencies as important ecological functions in agroecosystems. The available evidence suggests that mycorrhizal diversity positively contributes to nutrient and, possibly, water use efficiency. Soil fauna effects on nutrient and water use efficiencies are also apparent, but diversity effects may be indirect, through effects on soil structure. We present a conceptual diagram relating plant and soil biodiversity with soil structure and water and nutrient use efficiencies as a framework for future studies. We then consider how cropping systems design and management are interrelated and how management options might be interfaced with farmers' knowledge in taking management decisions. Finally, we attempt to express some economic benefits of soil biodiversity to society as part of a wider strategy of conserving and using agrobiodiversity.},

The AM fungal diversity of 3 agricultural exploitations located in the Pampa Ondulada region (Argentina) was assessed by using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing and morphological (based on spore traits) approaches. Two kinds of soil managements are found in these sites: agronomic and non-agronomic. A total of 188 molecular operational taxonomic units and 29 morphological species of AM fungi were identified. No effect of soil management on AM richness was detected. AM fungal communities were more diverse and equitable in the absence of agronomic management. In contrast, the results on {$\beta$}-diversity varied according to the methodology used. We concluded that agronomic management of soil has a negative effect on AM fungal community biodiversity in the Pampa Ondulada region. We also conclude that both methodologies complement each other in the study of AM fungal ecology. This study greatly improved the knowledge about AM fungi in South America where the molecular diversity of AM fungi was practically unknown.},

  abstract = {Capturing the complexity of soil life for soil quality assessments is one of the most challenging paradoxes of contemporary soil science. Soil biota perform a plethora of processes that are fundamental to soil quality. As the concept of soil quality developed, so have the attempts to integrate soil biological measurements into monitoring schemes from field to regional scale. To date, however, soil science has not yet succeeded to provide flexible yet objective biological indicator methods to assess soil multifunctionality, customised to the user's context. We present an integrative framework and elucidate the who and how of soil multifunctionality. The framework encompasses the current scientific understanding of the role of soil biota in supporting the many soil processes that underly soil quality. We specified these relationships for four soil functions (Carbon and Climate Regulation, Water Regulation and Purification, Nutrient Cycling, and Disease and Pest Regulation). We identify challenges often encountered in soil quality assessment and monitoring schemes and discuss how the framework can be applied to provide a flexible selection tool. Soil quality assessments are conducted in different contexts. As assessment objectives range from mechanistic understanding, to functional land management and large spatial scale monitoring so will the practical and logistical constraints for method selection vary. Biological assessments need to move beyond the quest for a one-size-fits-all minimum dataset, and adopt a more nuanced selection approach founded in soil biology. We stress that biological attributes should not be considered in isolation but alongside soil chemical and physical attributes, as well as management and environmental contextualisation. The presented framework offers a structure to further quantify, understand and communicate the who and how of soil biology in defining multifunctionality.},

  abstract = {1 Little consensus has been reached as to general features of spatial variation in beta diversity, a fundamental component of species diversity. This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult. 2 We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties. 3 Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between `broad sense' measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and `narrow sense' measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable. 4 We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted a, b and c) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.},

  abstract = {The belowground compartment of terrestrial ecosystems drives nutrient cycling, the decomposition and stabilisation of organic matter, and supports aboveground life. Belowground consumers create complex food webs that regulate functioning, ensure stability and support biodiversity both below and above ground. However, existing soil food-web reconstructions do not match recently accumulated empirical evidence and there is no comprehensive reproducible approach that accounts for the complex resource, size and spatial structure of food webs in soil. Here I build on generic food-web organisation principles and use multifunctional classification of soil protists, invertebrates and vertebrates, to reconstruct a `multichannel' food web across size classes of soil-associated consumers. I infer weighted trophic interactions among trophic guilds using feeding preferences and prey protection traits (evolutionarily inherited traits), size and spatial distributions (niche overlaps), and biomass-dependent feeding. I then use food-web reconstruction, together with assimilation efficiencies, to calculate energy fluxes assuming a steady-state energetic system. Based on energy fluxes, I propose a number of indicators, related to stability, biodiversity and multiple ecosystem-level functions such as herbivory, top-down control, translocation and transformation of organic matter. I illustrate this approach with an empirical example, comparing it with traditional resource-focused soil food-web reconstruction. The multichannel reconstruction can be used to assess `trophic multifunctionality' (analogous to ecosystem multifunctionality), i.e. simultaneous support of multiple trophic functions by the food web, and compare it across communities and ecosystems spanning beyond the soil. With further empirical validation of the proposed functional indicators, this multichannel reconstruction approach could provide an effective tool for understanding animal diversity--ecosystem functioning relationships in soil. This tool hopefully will inspire more researchers to describe soil communities and belowground--aboveground interactions comprehensively. Such studies will provide informative indicators for including consumers as active agents in biogeochemical models, not only locally but also on regional and global scales.},

  abstract = {Here we introduce the Soil BON Foodweb Team, a cross-continental collaborative network that aims to monitor soil animal communities and food webs using consistent methodology at a global scale. Soil animals support vital soil processes via soil structure modification, consumption of dead organic matter, and interactions with microbial and plant communities. Soil animal effects on ecosystem functions have been demonstrated by correlative analyses as well as in laboratory and field experiments, but these studies typically focus on selected animal groups or species at one or few sites with limited variation in environmental conditions. The lack of comprehensive harmonised large-scale soil animal community data including microfauna, mesofauna, and macrofauna, in conjunction with related soil functions, microbial communities, and vegetation, limits our understanding of biological interactions in soil systems and how these interactions affect ecosystem functioning. To provide such data, the Soil BON Foodweb Team invites researchers worldwide to use a common methodology to address six long-term goals: (1) to collect globally representative harmonised data on soil micro-, meso-, and macrofauna communities, (2) to describe key environmental drivers of soil animal communities and food webs, (3) to assess the efficiency of conservation approaches for the protection of soil animal communities, (4) to describe soil food webs and their association with soil functioning globally, (5) to establish a global research network for soil biodiversity monitoring and collaborative projects in related topics, (6) to reinforce local collaboration networks and expertise and support capacity building for soil animal research around the world. In this paper, we describe the vision of the global research network and the common sampling protocol to assess soil animal communities and advocate for the use of standard methodologies across observational and experimental soil animal studies. We will use this protocol to conduct soil animal assessments and reconstruct soil food webs at sites associated with the global soil biodiversity monitoring network, Soil BON, allowing us to assess linkages among soil biodiversity, vegetation, soil physico-chemical properties, climate, and ecosystem functions. In the present paper, we call for researchers especially from countries and ecoregions that remain underrepresented in the majority of soil biodiversity assessments to join us. Together we will be able to provide science-based evidence to support soil biodiversity conservation and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Soil-dwelling organisms populate the spaces---referred to as interstices---between the litter on the soil surface and the pores in the soil's organo-mineral matrix. These organisms have pivotal roles in soil ecosystem functions, such as the breakdown and decomposition of organic matter, the dispersal of bacterial and fungal spores and biological habitat transformation. These functions, in turn, contribute to broader ecosystem services like carbon and nutrient cycling, soil organic matter regulation and both chemical and physical soil fertility.This study provides morphological data pertaining to a range of soil organism sizes, specifically in Argiudol soils subjected to varying levels of agricultural activity in the Rolling Pampas Region, one of the world's most extensive and fertile plains.The primary focus is on soil microarthropods---namely, Acari (mites) and Collembola (springtails)---with a body width of less than 2 mm. These organisms constitute the majority of life in the intricate soil pore network. Additionally, the study documents species of earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitelata), recognised as ecosystem engineers for their ability to create physical channels in the soil matrix and to distribute organic matter. Moreover, the study includes measurements of morphological traits of soil-dwelling "macrofauna" (organisms with a body width greater than 2 mm), which are also implicated in various soil ecosystem functions. These include population regulation by apex predators, organic matter decomposition, biogenic structure formation, nutrient mobilisation and herbivory.In this paper, we report both the geographical locations and individual measurements of key morphological traits for over 7,000 specimens, covering a range of soil-dwelling organisms. These include springtails (Entognatha, Collembola), mites (Arachnida, Acari), earthworms (Oligochaeta, Crassiclitellata) and additional soil macrofauna. All specimens were collected from typical Argiudol soils located in three distinct agricultural systems characterised by varying levels of land-use intensity. To our knowledge, no other dataset exists providing this information for the Argentinian Pampas.},

Microbial anabolic metabolism in soil was stimulated by glucose addition. Simultaneous addition of eukaryote and/or prokaryote-specific antibiotics, which inhibit anabolic metabolism, fractionated the microbial biomass on the basis of selective respiratory inhibition. The improvements proposed here are that: (1) the glucose and antibiotic(s) are dissolved in water prior to addition to soil (the ratio of glucose and antibiotic(s) solution to dry weight of soil being 2 ml:l g); (2) maximal respiratory inhibition is required for each antibiotic; and (3) soil + glucose and antibiotic(s) solution are incubated for 3.5 h prior to the assay. The improved selective respiratory inhibition technique gave eukaryote:prokaryote (fungal:(discrete bacteria + actinomycete)) respiratory ratios of 1 for two soils under pasture, but failed to work on an arable soil. Mycelial (fungal + actinomycete):discrete bacterial biomass C ratios derived by the biovolume procedure were 1 and 2 for the soils under pasture and 3 for the arable soil.},
