*Mechanisms of Microarthropod-Microbial Interactions in Soil JOHN LUSSENHOP 1992*

Interactions among fungi, bacteria, and invertebrates are central to many processes in soil ranging from decomposition to the functioning of the rhizosphere.

Since mass is correlated with density, resource use, movement, and reproductive rate (Peters, 1983), microarthropods should interact with micro-organisms as grazers and transporters, while macroarthropods are primarily comminutors of litter, and nematodes and protozoa ar primarily bacterivores.

Microarthropods are the right size to graze fungi and bacteria. Their mouthparts function by plucking and scraping (collembola, mites), shearing (mites), or piercing (prostigmatid mites and protura).

Among fungi, interspecific and even intraspecific competition between mutually antagonistic dicaryons is strong and slows decomposition.

This is because saprophytic fungi gain access to resources by occupying volume with their hyphae.

There is evidence that resource partitioning among microarthropods results in small species and juveniles grazing bacteria, and larger individuals grazing fungi (Bakonyi, 1989).

Microarthropod grazing intensity is strong enough to control abundance and distribution of fungi.

Leaves falling into grassy areas with poor litter and low microarthropod populations were not subjected to intense grazing, and in these habitats walnut trees became infected the next year. (importancia en el control de pestes)

Microarthropod activity favors growth of bacteria, probably by mixing cells with fresh substrate. Even if microarthropods do not graze fungi, their activity may break hyphae just by walking through them

The possibility that invertebrate grazing stimulates fungal growth... Possible mechanisms include (a) fungal growth after senescent hyphae are grazed, and (b) regrowth after periodic grazing of actively growing mycelia.

Microarthropod habitats are rich in micro-organisms, microbial exoen-
zymes, and products of microbial degradation. For this reason ingestion of a
variety of microbially conditioned materials and trituration of food materials
may be the most important digestive adaptations of microarthropods.
Mouthparts of oribatids (Phthiracarus sp.: Dinsdale, 1974b), and collembola
(Tomocerus longicornis: Manton, 1977) function to minimize the size of food
particles; this probably enhances activity of microbial and endogenous
enzymes in the gut, and contributes in a minor way to comminution.

Gut micro-organisms of microarthropods are derived from the micro-
organisms they ingest (Seniczak and Stefaniak; 1978; Haq and Konikkara,
1988). The particular microbial species present in the gut effect time to
maturity and number of eggs laid in oribatids (Stefaniak and Seniczak,
1981). It is not surprising that collembola in culture can select hyphae with
the highest nutrient content (Leonard, 1984; Amelsvoort and Usher, 1989),
and that collembola produce more eggs when fed on fungi with higher
nitrogen content (Booth and Anderson, 1979).

Bacterial and fungal numbers are orders of magnitude higher around roots
than in soil away from roots (Curl and Truelove, 1986). Microarthropod
density is also higher around roots,...

Microarthropods carry fungal and probably bacterial inoculum to roots (demostrado con hongos patgenos de mani y ajo) 

Microarthropod grazing in the rhizosphere has a much more beneficial
effect than dispersal of inoculum. This is because pathogenic fungi apparently
lack antiherbivore defenses that saprophytic species have, and collembola
prefer grazing pathogens.

As fungivores, microarthropods strongly affect all aspects of mycorrhizal
growth and functioning, except dispersal.

The impact of microarthropods on VAM is likely to be small in highly
fertilized agricultural systems. But the literature just reviewed shows that
microarthropods decrease benefits of VAM both in natural habitats where
VAM may benefit members of plant populations locally or during brief
periods (Fitter, 1986), and in low-input agriculture where soil phosphorus
levels are low. (Efecto antagónico del consumo de colembolos sobre micorrizas en la liberacion de P)

*TROPHIC NETWORK ASSESSMENT OF GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEM STATUS O. Y. BUZHDYGAN, S. S. RUDENKO (2016)*

Ecological networks capture the organisms (identities) within the system and
multiple interactions between them. Such interactions serve for the exchange of the 
conservative substances, such as energy and matter, creating the complex structure 
and behavior of ecological systems. Network organization can be
considered as the reflection of ecosystem structure and functions.

Caught in the food web: complexity made simple? LAWRENCE R. POMEROY (2001)
 The empirical food web descriptions assembled by Cohen et al., (1990) fre-
quently contain “trophic species,” which are con- densations of a guild of species or sometimes much more. 
 “spherical horses.”
How effective condensation may be will depend on how similar the combined species 
are and what questions we ask about them. 
Communities are filled with this sort of minute complexity

An inherent difficulty in this is that populations, communities, and ecosystems are on
hierarchically different levels of organization (Allen, 1987) 
and have different return times (Slobodkin, 1961). 

By creating “trophic species,” modelers implicitly acknowledge species redundancy,

Early assumptions of a 10% “ecological efficiency” of each “trophic level” and later
assumptions of a generally high growth efficiency of heterotrophic bacteria of around
50%, have beenshown to be poor generalizations

Grazers and predators switch prey, and even “trophic levels,” as necessity dictates.

The structure of ecological communities is usually represented by food webs. 
In these webs, we describe species by means of
vertices connected by links representing the predations. 
We can therefore study different webs by considering the shape (topology) 
of these networks. 

Here vertices are trophic species12,24, defined as sets of biological species 
sharing the same predators and the same prey.

the observation of universality in food webs would highlight common organizing
principles across different ecosystems 

As a result of competition, not every species can prey on the same resource. 
Species therefore tend to differentiate and occupy more than one trophic level 
to coexist. However, empirical observations1–3,6–15 reveal that real food webs
display a small number of levels (usually in the range two to four)
even if the number of species is large, (which is consistent with our
finding that h is closer to 1 than to 2.)

Whereas the different nature of the interactions affects the number
of loops29 (and hence the stability), the structure of the spanning
trees seems to be invariant and universal. Correspondingly,
although the stability properties are likely to be determined by
different evolutionary processes, the efficiency of food webs might
be the result of a common organizing principle.

Detritus Food Webs in Conventional and No-tillage Agroecosistems. Paul F. Hendrix, Robert W. Parmelee, D. A. Crossley, Jr., DavidC. Coleman, Eugene P. Odum, andPeter M. Groffma (2014)

no-tillage agriculture-in which no plowing takes place and a surface 
mulch layer is left-creates conditions similar to those in undisturbed ecosystem
In natural ecosystems, decomposition and mineralization of plant and animal 
detritus regulate the availability of nutrients for plant uptake or loss from the system

A vast literature exists on the biology and ecology of soil organisms  
but we know relatively little about the integrated functioning
of detritus food webs.
In natural ecosystems, both direct and indirect interactions among the soil biota are
involved in the decomposition of organic matter. For example, mi-
croarthropods (mites and collembolans) affect bacteria and fungi directly
by grazing on microbial biomass and indirectly by fragmenting and 
consuming plant residue.The latter activity increases the surface area of the
residue and enriches it via passage through the gut, thereby enhancing its
quality as a microbial substrate and accelerating its decomposition.
...  interactions among trophic groups influence both the rate and 
direction of nutrient flux through litter and soil.

Only a few studies have characterized detritus food webs and 
their activity in agroecosystems.

high decomposition rates in a plowed soil were associated with bacteria-based 
food webs dominated by organisms with high metabolic activity.

...concluded that plowing favors food webs comprising soil organisms 
with short generation times, small body size, rapid dispersal, and 
omnivorous feeding habits
 

*Food web complexity and stability across habitat connectivity gradients
Robin M. LeCraw · Pavel Kratina · Diane S. Srivastava*

Aquí se realiza una revisión interesante que relaciona las redes en parches.

Connectivity within ecosystems determines the movement and dispersal of species,
influencing community structure and maintaining ecological function.

Food web complexity encompasses numerous metrics, such as food chain length (FCL) (Post
2002), connectance (DeAngelis 1975), link density (Pimm et al. 1991), 
degree of omnivory (Pimm and Lawton 1978), and number of branching links (Pillai et al.
2011). While all of these metrics attempt to quantify “complexity,” they
may measure different properties of food webs (Dunne
et al. 2002). For example, link density (the average number
of links per species) tends to increase with food web size,
whereas connectance (the proportion of all possible links
realized in a food web) does not (Martinez 1992). Another
metric of complexity which has been more recently defined
is the number of branching links (i.e., “forks” in a food web
diagram), which quantifies how many consumers can be
supported by a common resource (Pillai et al. 2011)

Stability is a multifaceted aspect of food webs that includes
resistance and resilience to environmental perturbations, the occurrence 
of stable point equilibria, variability, alternative attractors, limit cycles and chaos

*Food web complexity affects stoichiometric and trophic interactions
Antonia Liess, Jens Olsson, Mario Quevedo, Peter Eklöv, Tobias Vrede and Helmut Hillebrand(2006)*

Top predators can have substantial effects on species
lower down in the food web (Power 1990, Persson 1999,
Lögren and Persson 2002), either through numerical
predation or through indirect pathways. Predators ingest
prey and recycle nutrient, thereby increasing the nutrient
availability of primary producers (Sterner and Elser
2002).

...in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as such,
provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web
models.
Connectance, the number of actual links (L) expressed as a proportion of the total
number of possible feeding links (S2 in a web of S species), typically 
lies between 0.02 and 0.4 in empirical data.

*Is biodiversity maintained by food-web complexity?—the adaptive food-web hypothesis
Michio Kondoh (2019)*

In nature, a number of species are interconnected by trophic links, 
resulting in a complex food-web network
 
In a food web, a species affects, and is affected by, other species not 
only through direct resource–consumer interactions but also through
the indirect interactions mediated by other species

Indirect effects between species are quite sensitive to food-web topology 
and the positions of the focal species within the web (Yodzis 2000). Small
differences in food-web topology or interaction strength can lead to large 
changes in indirect effects

Nevertheless, it may still be possible to predict how food-web structure 
affects the grosser dynamic properties of the food web. An example of such
a property is ‘‘population stability’’ (May 1973;
Goodman 1975; Pimm 1991). Theory suggests that
there is statistical regularity in how population
stability changes with changes in the food-web
structure (see Pimm 1991). Several components
of population stability have been considered,
including resilience (i.e. the rate at which popu-
lation density returns to equilibrium after a dis-
turbance), feasibility (the system is at equilibrium
with all existing populations), asymptotic local
stability (the system returns to equilibrium after
a slight disturbance), global asymptotic stability
(the system returns to equilibrium after any level
of disturbance), persistence, and permanence (the
system does not lose species). I briefly review these
studies in the following section.

The analysis showed that the local asymptotic stability of the population, 
on average, decreased with increasing food-web complexity.

Increasing the species richness or connectance
decreases feasibility

Increasing the length of trophic chains decreases resilience

Omnivory, that is, feeding at more than one trophic level, lowers local asymptotic stability

Increasing connectance or species richness lowers permanence and global
asymptotic stability

The starting point of the latter idea is to recog-
nize that for a given food-web complexity,
several possible food-web architectures exist,
some of which may be stable, while others are not.

Some studies have found that when using food-
web models with realistic structures, increasing
complexity does not destabilize populations

showed that if the effect of predators on
prey is sufficiently larger than that of prey on
predators (e.g. low conversion rate), increasing the
complexity enhances the asymptotic stability of the
equilibrium point

Other studies have proposed a
correlation between food-web complexity (species
richness, connectance) and interaction strength,
which influences the complexity–stability relation-
ship In the presence of
the negative correlation between connectance and
interaction strength, increasing complexity may
stabilize population dynamics

Neutel et al. (2002) showed that pyramid-like
biomass distribution between trophic levels results
in an interaction strength that enhances food-web
stability. Emmerson and Raffaelli (2004) pointed
out that interaction strength derived from the
relative body sizes of prey and predator promotes
population stability.

An important property of trophic links that
has been more or less overlooked in previous
complexity–stability debates is flexibility. Earlier
studies tended to assume static food-web struc-
tures. However, in reality, the position and
strength of a trophic link are not fixed, but
are spatiotemporally variable. The linkage pattern changes
over time as a trophic link may be activated or
inactivated

If such flexibility is a general property of a trophic link,
then a food-web structure composed of a single set
of nodes and links represents only a certain time
period and cannot serve to represent population
dynamics over the long term.

A general mechanism through which food-web
flexibility arises is adaptation. Adaptation is a
distinguishing feature of organisms and occurs at
several different biological levels.

There are two types of adaptations that can
influence the strength of a trophic interaction,
that is, adaptive defenses by prey (Fryxell and
Lundberg 1997; Abrams 2000; Bolker et al. 2003)
and adaptive foraging by predators (Emlen 1966;
MacArthur and Pianka 1966). Consider a predator
and a prey species connected by a trophic link.
From the viewpoint of the prey, the trophic link is
a path through which it loses its body mass,
opportunities for reproduction, or life. Therefore,
prey adapts to reduce the risk of predation through
a variety of behavioral or morphological changes
(antipredator defenses; Endler 1986; Lima and Dill
1996), which include choosing a habitat with less
risk of predation, developing a morphological
structure that prevents consumption, producing toxins, and shifting their active time.
Such antipredator defenses weaken the strength of the
trophic link. From the viewpoint of the predator,
on the other hand, a trophic link is a path through
which energy and nutrients are gained. A predator
influences the strength of trophic interactions to
maximize its energetic gain from the potential
resources (Emlen 1966; MacArthur and Pianka
1966). Some resources are extensively searched
for or captured to strengthen the trophic link,
while others are discarded from the diet, thereby
weakening the link.

Species richness and connectance are used as indices of food-web complexity. 

Population stability is measured by
population persistence, which is defined as the
probability that a randomly chosen species goes
extinct within a given time period

* Trophic Interactions of Fungi and Animals. Liliane Ruess, John Lussenhop (2004) * 
Among the soil mesofauna, protura are predominantly fungal feeding, in particular
on ectomycorrhiza (Sturm, 1959). They are known to prefer freshly mycorrhized root tips,
but feed also on fungal hyphae growing through the soil (Nosek, 1975). There is evidence
that they are highly dependent on the mycorrhizal symbiosis,

...many collembola are generalist feeders and switch their preferences 
due to availability of food 
Through their comminution, grazing, and spore dispersal collembola have 
significant impact on the soil fungal community (Visser, 1985)

Enchytraeids are key grazers in northern soils. Didden et al. (1997) found them to be
80% microbivorous (bacteria and fungi) and 20% saprophagous. 

Feeding preferences of collembola for functional groups of fungi have been deter-
mined by field and microcosm experiments. Curl (1988) and Lartey et al. (1989) found
that the plant pathogen Rhizoctonia solani was grazed by collembola in preference to
the saprophytes Gliocladium virens and Trichoderma harzianum, thus increasing the
survivorship of cotton seedlings in commercial fields. Subsequently, Gaeumannomyces
graminis var . tritici and Fusarium culmorum were shown to be grazed by the collembolan
O. armatus, thus decreasing the severity of fungal disease of wheat seedlings in laboratory
experiments (Sabatini and Innocenti, 2001). Klironomos and Kendrick (1996) used
microcosms containing sugar maple seedlings to show that three mite and three collem-
bolan species preferred feeding on saprophytic over arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

Soil food webs may have four to eight trophic levels (Hunt et al., 1987), and many
of the organisms are omnivorous. 

Stressing that trophic cascades are of limited importance in soil communities does
not imply that the structure of the food web may not affect the belowground system. The
ability of animals to regulate processes such as energy flow depends on the sum of their
biotic interactions at the same trophic level (e.g., competition) and at 
different trophic levels (e.g., predation, grazing, competition) (Moore et al., 1988). 
Hereby their input is more related to function than taxonomic relationship. The
fungal-based food web in Figure 28.1 is organized in terms of faunal groups that 
have similar feeding habits. 
These feeding groups serve as a link between species interactions and energy flow through the web. 
As indicated, it is likely that each group has more than one fungal food source and 
that the groups share a common predator. This high degree of connectance in the web
results in functional redundancy and resilience to perturbation (Ferris et al., 2001).

By recycling of organic material belowground, trophic interactions in soil form the
basis for plant life aboveground. 
Soil fungivores input into these processes at three different levels: comminution,
dissemination, and grazing. While dissemination is an
indirect effect by transport of fungi and their spores, comminution and grazing have a
direct influence. Generally, fungal grazing by micro- and mesofauna enhances mineral-
ization and accelerates decomposition rates and energy transport 

Feces are an important component of the soil. After consumption and defecation,
resources have a changed chemical quality. The soil mesofauna comminutes fungi directly
by feeding. Besides, in their feces material nutrients are mobilized and inhibitory
effects of secondary metabolites are removed, which may stimulate fungal growth

resources have a changed chemical quality. The soil mesofauna comminutes fungi directly
by feeding. Besides, in their feces material nutrients are mobilized and inhibitory
effects of secondary metabolites are removed, which may stimulate fungal growth.
Generally, the consumption of decaying litter is more due to increasing fungal 
content (in the course of decomposition) than to a decrease in its mechanical resistance

Grazing effects of the fauna are likely greater in the early decomposition phase, when
microbial activity is high, whereas comminution effects are more important in the 
later phase

We measured stability as the minimum degree of relative intraspecific interaction 
needed for matrix stability (s); we called matrices with a smaller s “more stable” (11).
We found that loop weights of the longer loops were low in the real matrix, whereas in
randomized matrices the longer loops tended to be heavier than the shorter loops

It is a well-known regularity that the absolute values of the effects of predators on 
their prey are, on average, two orders of magnitude larger than the values of the
effects of prey on their predators 
A strong biomass decrease over trophic levels, together with the fact that predators
may feed on several prey types, caused weak links to aggregate in long loops

The omnivore feeds on two prey types, which are at different trophic levels.

Looking at the complexity of the 104 webs, we found that the more
complex webs contained relatively long loops (Fig. 4A) but had roughly the same maximum
loop weight and stability as less complex webs with shorter loops.
