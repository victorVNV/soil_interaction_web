*Beetles feeding on bugs (Coleoptera, Hemiptera) repeated shifts from mycophagous ancestors
Leschen 2000 <DOI:10.1071/IT00025>*

De aca se tomará que estos escarabajos son fungivoros.

A review of the literature shows that predation on Hemiptera (mainly Sternorrhyncha) by
Coleoptera is widespread in the order, but little understood, even from a biocontrol
perspective. Phylogenetic information indicates that feeding on hemipterans evolved
predominantly in lineages containing fungus feeders (Derodontidae, Silvanidae, Laemophloeidae,
Nitidulidae, Endomychidae, Anthribidae) and whose ancestors were fungus feeders (Coccinellidae)
or were sap feeders (cetoniine Scarabaeidae). Other predators on Hemiptera whose ancestry could
not be determined unequivocally (predatory/phytophagy or phytophagy/mycophagy) are included in
families that contain a large number of species that are mycophagous (Trogossitidae,
Mycetophagidae, and Salpingidae). Because changes in diet to feeding on hemipterans have
repeatedly occurred in mycophagous taxa, and this shift is not present in other largely
predatory groups of beetles, it is presumed that certain preconditions, which have promoted
this specialised behaviour, only exist in these lineages. Ancestral associations with sooty
moulds that grow on honeydew may have mediated shifts from mycophagy to predation, rather than
having ancestors that were predatory and attracted to a novel prey type. Natural history data
show that species that prey on Hemiptera also feed on honeydew and sooty moulds and a model is
presented for the host shift from mycophagy to feeding on Hemiptera. An annotated list of
Hemiptera prey for beetles (exclusive of Coccinellidae) includes records for species in the
families Adelgidae, Aleyrodidae, Aphididae, Coccidae, Diaspididae, Kermesidae, Kerriidae,
Margarodidae, Membracidae, Phoenicococcidae, and Pseudococcidae.

*Mechanisms of Microarthropod-Microbial Interactions in Soil JOHN LUSSENHOP 1992*

Interactions among fungi, bacteria, and invertebrates are central to many processes in soil
ranging from decomposition to the functioning of the rhizosphere.

Since mass is correlated with density, resource use, movement, and reproductive rate (Peters,
1983), microarthropods should interact with micro-organisms as grazers and transporters, while
macroarthropods are primarily comminutors of litter, and nematodes and protozoa ar primarily
bacterivores.

Microarthropods are the right size to graze fungi and bacteria. Their mouthparts function by
plucking and scraping (collembola, mites), shearing (mites), or piercing (prostigmatid mites
and protura).

Among fungi, interspecific and even intraspecific competition between mutually antagonistic
dicaryons is strong and slows decomposition.

This is because saprophytic fungi gain access to resources by occupying volume with their
hyphae.

There is evidence that resource partitioning among microarthropods results in small species and
juveniles grazing bacteria, and larger individuals grazing fungi (Bakonyi, 1989).

Microarthropod grazing intensity is strong enough to control abundance and distribution of
fungi.

Leaves falling into grassy areas with poor litter and low microarthropod populations were not
subjected to intense grazing, and in these habitats walnut trees became infected the next year.
(importancia en el control de pestes)

Microarthropod activity favors growth of bacteria, probably by mixing cells with fresh
substrate. Even if microarthropods do not graze fungi, their activity may break hyphae just by
walking through them

The possibility that invertebrate grazing stimulates fungal growth... Possible mechanisms
include (a) fungal growth after senescent hyphae are grazed, and (b) regrowth after periodic
grazing of actively growing mycelia.

Microarthropod habitats are rich in micro-organisms, microbial exoen- zymes, and products of
microbial degradation. For this reason ingestion of a variety of microbially conditioned
materials and trituration of food materials may be the most important digestive adaptations of
microarthropods. Mouthparts of oribatids (Phthiracarus sp.: Dinsdale, 1974b), and collembola
(Tomocerus longicornis: Manton, 1977) function to minimize the size of food particles; this
probably enhances activity of microbial and endogenous enzymes in the gut, and contributes in a
minor way to comminution.

Gut micro-organisms of microarthropods are derived from the micro- organisms they ingest
(Seniczak and Stefaniak; 1978; Haq and Konikkara, 1988). The particular microbial species
present in the gut effect time to maturity and number of eggs laid in oribatids (Stefaniak and
Seniczak, 1981). It is not surprising that collembola in culture can select hyphae with the
highest nutrient content (Leonard, 1984; Amelsvoort and Usher, 1989), and that collembola
produce more eggs when fed on fungi with higher nitrogen content (Booth and Anderson, 1979).

Bacterial and fungal numbers are orders of magnitude higher around roots than in soil away from
roots (Curl and Truelove, 1986). Microarthropod density is also higher around roots,...

Microarthropods carry fungal and probably bacterial inoculum to roots (demostrado con hongos
patgenos de mani y ajo)

Microarthropod grazing in the rhizosphere has a much more beneficial effect than dispersal of
inoculum. This is because pathogenic fungi apparently lack antiherbivore defenses that
saprophytic species have, and collembola prefer grazing pathogens.

As fungivores, microarthropods strongly affect all aspects of mycorrhizal growth and
functioning, except dispersal.

The impact of microarthropods on VAM is likely to be small in highly fertilized agricultural
systems. But the literature just reviewed shows that microarthropods decrease benefits of VAM
both in natural habitats where VAM may benefit members of plant populations locally or during
brief periods (Fitter, 1986), and in low-input agriculture where soil phosphorus levels are
low. (Efecto antagónico del consumo de colembolos sobre micorrizas en la liberacion de P)

*TROPHIC NETWORK ASSESSMENT OF GRASSLAND ECOSYSTEM STATUS O. Y. BUZHDYGAN, S. S. RUDENKO
(2016)*

Ecological networks capture the organisms (identities) within the system and multiple
interactions between them. Such interactions serve for the exchange of the conservative
substances, such as energy and matter, creating the complex structure and behavior of
ecological systems. Network organization can be considered as the reflection of ecosystem
structure and functions.

Allometry, biocomplexity, and web topology of hundred agro-environments in The Netherlands
Christian Mulder \*, Henri den Hollander, Ton Schouten, Michiel Rutgers (2006)

starting point is the observation that animals are not randomly distributed (Ghilarov, 1944,
1965) as their body mass and their numerical abundance are not independent

Caught in the food web: complexity made simple? LAWRENCE R. POMEROY (2001) The empirical food
web descriptions assembled by Cohen et al., (1990) fre- quently contain “trophic species,”
which are con- densations of a guild of species or sometimes much more. “spherical horses.” How
effective condensation may be will depend on how similar the combined species are and what
questions we ask about them. Communities are filled with this sort of minute complexity

An inherent difficulty in this is that populations, communities, and ecosystems are on
hierarchically different levels of organization (Allen, 1987) and have different return times
(Slobodkin, 1961).

By creating “trophic species,” modelers implicitly acknowledge species redundancy,

Early assumptions of a 10% “ecological efficiency” of each “trophic level” and later
assumptions of a generally high growth efficiency of heterotrophic bacteria of around 50%, have
beenshown to be poor generalizations

Grazers and predators switch prey, and even “trophic levels,” as necessity dictates.

The structure of ecological communities is usually represented by food webs. In these webs, we
describe species by means of vertices connected by links representing the predations. We can
therefore study different webs by considering the shape (topology) of these networks.

Here vertices are trophic species12,24, defined as sets of biological species sharing the same
predators and the same prey.

the observation of universality in food webs would highlight common organizing principles
across different ecosystems

As a result of competition, not every species can prey on the same resource. Species therefore
tend to differentiate and occupy more than one trophic level to coexist. However, empirical
observations1–3,6–15 reveal that real food webs display a small number of levels (usually in
the range two to four) even if the number of species is large, (which is consistent with our
finding that h is closer to 1 than to 2.)

Whereas the different nature of the interactions affects the number of loops29 (and hence the
stability), the structure of the spanning trees seems to be invariant and universal.
Correspondingly, although the stability properties are likely to be determined by different
evolutionary processes, the efficiency of food webs might be the result of a common organizing
principle.

Detritus Food Webs in Conventional and No-tillage Agroecosistems. Paul F. Hendrix, Robert W.
Parmelee, D. A. Crossley, Jr., DavidC. Coleman, Eugene P. Odum, andPeter M. Groffma (2014)

no-tillage agriculture-in which no plowing takes place and a surface mulch layer is
left-creates conditions similar to those in undisturbed ecosystem In natural ecosystems,
decomposition and mineralization of plant and animal detritus regulate the availability of
nutrients for plant uptake or loss from the system

A vast literature exists on the biology and ecology of soil organisms\
but we know relatively little about the integrated functioning of detritus food webs. In
natural ecosystems, both direct and indirect interactions among the soil biota are involved in
the decomposition of organic matter. For example, mi- croarthropods (mites and collembolans)
affect bacteria and fungi directly by grazing on microbial biomass and indirectly by
fragmenting and consuming plant residue.The latter activity increases the surface area of the
residue and enriches it via passage through the gut, thereby enhancing its quality as a
microbial substrate and accelerating its decomposition. ... interactions among trophic groups
influence both the rate and direction of nutrient flux through litter and soil.

Only a few studies have characterized detritus food webs and their activity in agroecosystems.

high decomposition rates in a plowed soil were associated with bacteria-based food webs
dominated by organisms with high metabolic activity.

...concluded that plowing favors food webs comprising soil organisms with short generation
times, small body size, rapid dispersal, and omnivorous feeding habits

*Food web complexity and stability across habitat connectivity gradients Robin M. LeCraw ·
Pavel Kratina · Diane S. Srivastava*

Aquí se realiza una revisión interesante que relaciona las redes en parches.

Connectivity within ecosystems determines the movement and dispersal of species, influencing
community structure and maintaining ecological function.

Food web complexity encompasses numerous metrics, such as food chain length (FCL) (Post 2002),
connectance (DeAngelis 1975), link density (Pimm et al. 1991), degree of omnivory (Pimm and
Lawton 1978), and number of branching links (Pillai et al. 2011). While all of these metrics
attempt to quantify “complexity,” they may measure different properties of food webs (Dunne et
al. 2002). For example, link density (the average number of links per species) tends to
increase with food web size, whereas connectance (the proportion of all possible links realized
in a food web) does not (Martinez 1992). Another metric of complexity which has been more
recently defined is the number of branching links (i.e., “forks” in a food web diagram), which
quantifies how many consumers can be supported by a common resource (Pillai et al. 2011)

Stability is a multifaceted aspect of food webs that includes resistance and resilience to
environmental perturbations, the occurrence of stable point equilibria, variability,
alternative attractors, limit cycles and chaos

*Food web complexity affects stoichiometric and trophic interactions Antonia Liess, Jens
Olsson, Mario Quevedo, Peter Eklöv, Tobias Vrede and Helmut Hillebrand(2006)*

Top predators can have substantial effects on species lower down in the food web (Power 1990,
Persson 1999, Lögren and Persson 2002), either through numerical predation or through indirect
pathways. Predators ingest prey and recycle nutrient, thereby increasing the nutrient
availability of primary producers (Sterner and Elser 2002).

*Foraging biology predicts food web complexity Andrew P. Beckerman, Owen L. Petchey, and Philip
H. Warren(2006)* ...in which network properties emerge from the behavior of individuals and, as
such, provides a mechanistic explanation of connectance currently lacking in food web models.
Connectance, the number of actual links (L) expressed as a proportion of the total number of
possible feeding links (S2 in a web of S species), typically lies between 0.02 and 0.4 in
empirical data.

*Is biodiversity maintained by food-web complexity?—the adaptive food-web hypothesis Michio
Kondoh (2019)*

In nature, a number of species are interconnected by trophic links, resulting in a complex
food-web network

In a food web, a species affects, and is affected by, other species not only through direct
resource–consumer interactions but also through the indirect interactions mediated by other
species

Indirect effects between species are quite sensitive to food-web topology and the positions of
the focal species within the web (Yodzis 2000). Small differences in food-web topology or
interaction strength can lead to large changes in indirect effects

Nevertheless, it may still be possible to predict how food-web structure affects the grosser
dynamic properties of the food web. An example of such a property is ‘‘population stability’’
(May 1973; Goodman 1975; Pimm 1991). Theory suggests that there is statistical regularity in
how population stability changes with changes in the food-web structure (see Pimm 1991).
Several components of population stability have been considered, including resilience (i.e. the
rate at which popu- lation density returns to equilibrium after a dis- turbance), feasibility
(the system is at equilibrium with all existing populations), asymptotic local stability (the
system returns to equilibrium after a slight disturbance), global asymptotic stability (the
system returns to equilibrium after any level of disturbance), persistence, and permanence (the
system does not lose species). I briefly review these studies in the following section.

The analysis showed that the local asymptotic stability of the population, on average,
decreased with increasing food-web complexity.

Increasing the species richness or connectance decreases feasibility

Increasing the length of trophic chains decreases resilience

Omnivory, that is, feeding at more than one trophic level, lowers local asymptotic stability

Increasing connectance or species richness lowers permanence and global asymptotic stability

The starting point of the latter idea is to recog- nize that for a given food-web complexity,
several possible food-web architectures exist, some of which may be stable, while others are
not.

Some studies have found that when using food- web models with realistic structures, increasing
complexity does not destabilize populations

showed that if the effect of predators on prey is sufficiently larger than that of prey on
predators (e.g. low conversion rate), increasing the complexity enhances the asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium point

Other studies have proposed a correlation between food-web complexity (species richness,
connectance) and interaction strength, which influences the complexity–stability relation- ship
In the presence of the negative correlation between connectance and interaction strength,
increasing complexity may stabilize population dynamics

Neutel et al. (2002) showed that pyramid-like biomass distribution between trophic levels
results in an interaction strength that enhances food-web stability. Emmerson and Raffaelli
(2004) pointed out that interaction strength derived from the relative body sizes of prey and
predator promotes population stability.

An important property of trophic links that has been more or less overlooked in previous
complexity–stability debates is flexibility. Earlier studies tended to assume static food-web
struc- tures. However, in reality, the position and strength of a trophic link are not fixed,
but are spatiotemporally variable. The linkage pattern changes over time as a trophic link may
be activated or inactivated

If such flexibility is a general property of a trophic link, then a food-web structure composed
of a single set of nodes and links represents only a certain time period and cannot serve to
represent population dynamics over the long term.

A general mechanism through which food-web flexibility arises is adaptation. Adaptation is a
distinguishing feature of organisms and occurs at several different biological levels.

There are two types of adaptations that can influence the strength of a trophic interaction,
that is, adaptive defenses by prey (Fryxell and Lundberg 1997; Abrams 2000; Bolker et al. 2003)
and adaptive foraging by predators (Emlen 1966; MacArthur and Pianka 1966). Consider a predator
and a prey species connected by a trophic link. From the viewpoint of the prey, the trophic
link is a path through which it loses its body mass, opportunities for reproduction, or life.
Therefore, prey adapts to reduce the risk of predation through a variety of behavioral or
morphological changes (antipredator defenses; Endler 1986; Lima and Dill 1996), which include
choosing a habitat with less risk of predation, developing a morphological structure that
prevents consumption, producing toxins, and shifting their active time. Such antipredator
defenses weaken the strength of the trophic link. From the viewpoint of the predator, on the
other hand, a trophic link is a path through which energy and nutrients are gained. A predator
influences the strength of trophic interactions to maximize its energetic gain from the
potential resources (Emlen 1966; MacArthur and Pianka 1966). Some resources are extensively
searched for or captured to strengthen the trophic link, while others are discarded from the
diet, thereby weakening the link.

Species richness and connectance are used as indices of food-web complexity.

Population stability is measured by population persistence, which is defined as the probability
that a randomly chosen species goes extinct within a given time period

-   Trophic Interactions of Fungi and Animals. Liliane Ruess, John Lussenhop (2004) \* Among
    the soil mesofauna, protura are predominantly fungal feeding, in particular on
    ectomycorrhiza (Sturm, 1959). They are known to prefer freshly mycorrhized root tips, but
    feed also on fungal hyphae growing through the soil (Nosek, 1975). There is evidence that
    they are highly dependent on the mycorrhizal symbiosis,

...many collembola are generalist feeders and switch their preferences due to availability of
food Through their comminution, grazing, and spore dispersal collembola have significant impact
on the soil fungal community (Visser, 1985)

Enchytraeids are key grazers in northern soils. Didden et al. (1997) found them to be 80%
microbivorous (bacteria and fungi) and 20% saprophagous.

Feeding preferences of collembola for functional groups of fungi have been deter- mined by
field and microcosm experiments. Curl (1988) and Lartey et al. (1989) found that the plant
pathogen Rhizoctonia solani was grazed by collembola in preference to the saprophytes
Gliocladium virens and Trichoderma harzianum, thus increasing the survivorship of cotton
seedlings in commercial fields. Subsequently, Gaeumannomyces graminis var . tritici and
Fusarium culmorum were shown to be grazed by the collembolan O. armatus, thus decreasing the
severity of fungal disease of wheat seedlings in laboratory experiments (Sabatini and
Innocenti, 2001). Klironomos and Kendrick (1996) used microcosms containing sugar maple
seedlings to show that three mite and three collem- bolan species preferred feeding on
saprophytic over arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi

Soil food webs may have four to eight trophic levels (Hunt et al., 1987), and many of the
organisms are omnivorous.

Stressing that trophic cascades are of limited importance in soil communities does not imply
that the structure of the food web may not affect the belowground system. The ability of
animals to regulate processes such as energy flow depends on the sum of their biotic
interactions at the same trophic level (e.g., competition) and at different trophic levels
(e.g., predation, grazing, competition) (Moore et al., 1988). Hereby their input is more
related to function than taxonomic relationship. The fungal-based food web in Figure 28.1 is
organized in terms of faunal groups that have similar feeding habits. These feeding groups
serve as a link between species interactions and energy flow through the web. As indicated, it
is likely that each group has more than one fungal food source and that the groups share a
common predator. This high degree of connectance in the web results in functional redundancy
and resilience to perturbation (Ferris et al., 2001).

By recycling of organic material belowground, trophic interactions in soil form the basis for
plant life aboveground. Soil fungivores input into these processes at three different levels:
comminution, dissemination, and grazing. While dissemination is an indirect effect by transport
of fungi and their spores, comminution and grazing have a direct influence. Generally, fungal
grazing by micro- and mesofauna enhances mineral- ization and accelerates decomposition rates
and energy transport

Feces are an important component of the soil. After consumption and defecation, resources have
a changed chemical quality. The soil mesofauna comminutes fungi directly by feeding. Besides,
in their feces material nutrients are mobilized and inhibitory effects of secondary metabolites
are removed, which may stimulate fungal growth

Feces are an important component of the soil. After consumption and defecation, resources have
a changed chemical quality. The soil mesofauna comminutes fungi directly by feeding. Besides,
in their feces material nutrients are mobilized and inhibitory effects of secondary metabolites
are removed, which may stimulate fungal growth. Generally, the consumption of decaying litter
is more due to increasing fungal content (in the course of decomposition) than to a decrease in
its mechanical resistance

Grazing effects of the fauna are likely greater in the early decomposition phase, when
microbial activity is high, whereas comminution effects are more important in the later phase

*Stability in Real Food Webs: Weak Links in Long Loops Anje-Margriet Neutel,1 Johan A. P.

We measured stability as the minimum degree of relative intraspecific interaction needed for
matrix stability (s); we called matrices with a smaller s “more stable” (11). We found that
loop weights of the longer loops were low in the real matrix, whereas in randomized matrices
the longer loops tended to be heavier than the shorter loops

It is a well-known regularity that the absolute values of the effects of predators on their
prey are, on average, two orders of magnitude larger than the values of the effects of prey on
their predators A strong biomass decrease over trophic levels, together with the fact that
predators may feed on several prey types, caused weak links to aggregate in long loops

The omnivore feeds on two prey types, which are at different trophic levels.

Looking at the complexity of the 104 webs, we found that the more complex webs contained
relatively long loops (Fig. 4A) but had roughly the same maximum loop weight and stability as
less complex webs with shorter loops.

*Community Structure of Complex Networks Hua-Wei Shen (2013)* This phenomenon tells us that the
organiza- tion of network is modular. Network scientists call this phenomenon as community
structure of networks

In their seminal paper, the communities are identified in a divisive way, where links are
deleted iteratively according to the measurement “edge betweenness”. This measurement
quantifies the importance of the role of the edges in bridging the communication of signals
transmitted along the shortest path.

In general, communities of network are groups of nodes within which nodes are much more
connected to each other than to the rest part of the network.

*The enigma of soil animal species diversity. Anderson en Progress of soil zoology 1973* pp.
51 - 56 Slobodkin et al. (1967) have argued on logical grounds that there cannot be an excess
of food available to decomposers, at least in ecosystems in steady state, as there is no
evidence of long term accumulation of organic detritus in terrestrial ecosystems. It is
arguable, however, as to whether even mature temperate ecosystems, such as climax woodlands,
attain steady state conditions but rather exist in a highly dynamic state of long term
equilibrium.

Predators may have a fundamental role in maintaining the species diversity of animal
communities by holding down their prey populations to levels where competition between the prey
species is reduced.

Energetic food webs. Libro. Moore & de Rutier 2012
The number of trophic levels refers to the number of energy states (sensu Odum,
1953) that the system possesses. pp44

Soil harbors a large part of the world’s biodiversity organized in highly complex
community food webs (e.g., Wolters, 1997, Griffiths et al., 2000). The primary energy sources of soil food webs are formed by various types of organic matter and root-derived materials.   Within soil webs we find organisms from many of the
dominant taxa at various trophic levels, representing a wide array of morphological
and physiological types, and life history strategies, that span several orders of
magnitudes in mass, movement, and processing rates. The lower trophic levels
consists of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, that utilize detritus, soil
organic matter, and plant products, and herbivorous nematodes and insects that feed
on roots. The microorganisms are by far the most dominant groups of soil organ-
isms, in terms of numbers as well as biomass (Andrén et al., 1990, Bloem et al.,
1994). At the higher trophic levels, soil food webs generally contain a large variety
of fauna such as protozoa (amoebae, flagellates, ciliates), nematodes (bacterivores,
fungivores, omnivores, herbivores, and predators), micro-arthropods such as mites
(bacterivores, fungivores, predators), Collembola (fungivores and predators), and
enchytraeids and oligochetes. Furthermore, there are also larger organisms that feed
on almost all trophic levels, such as earthworms. Soil food webs have been the
subject of several large multidisciplinary research programs, as soil processes are
controlled by the dynamics and interactions in the soil community food web (de
Ruiter et al., 1993a, de Ruiter et al., 1993b, Moore and Hunt, 1988). Moreover,
because of the large amounts of materials that are decomposed and processed, soil
food webs are thought to govern major components in the global cycling of
materials, energy, and nutrients (Wolters, 1997, Griffiths et al., 2000).

There is little accumulation of
plant litter, as much of the aboveground production remains in place as standing
dead, rather than falling to the soil surface. This aspect of the shortgrass steppe
makes it like many grassland ecosystems, as plant roots provide the major input of
carbon to soil. As such, plant roots are the focal point of biological activity in soils
and form the base of the belowground food web (Coleman et al., 1983). <!-- lo que observe o hice notar en body size con respecto al naturalizado--> pp.55

Food sources include the basal resources and other functional groups. Groups that are separated by
feeding mode are groups that feed on similar sources but by different means and strategies. pp.56

As the functional groups are based on food sources, adding or deleting functional
groups would necessarily change the vectors of interaction within the food web.
Changes of this type can alter the outcomes of both quantitative and qualitative
analyses of diversity, patterns of interactions within webs, ratios of functional types,
importance of key interactions and species, and the resilience and stability of food
webs. pp60

 The top predators in the soil system—like those in
others—are omnivores, given that they have adapted to feeding on organisms of
different morphologies regardless of where they might have obtained their energy,
e.g., predaceous mites and predatory nematodes feed on nematodes in different
trophic levels pp.69

 The description is based on functional groupings of species that are
aggregated using criteria borrowed from niche theory: food source, feeding mode,
habitat selection, and life history. The strength of the approach stems from its
simplicity and linkage to theory, inclusion of organic and inorganic components,
living and dead organic matter, and the adoption of biomass carbon and biomass
nitrogen as common currencies. The weakness in the approach stems from its use of
aggregates of species, and the use of temporal and spatial averaging. pp71
